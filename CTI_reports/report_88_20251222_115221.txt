APT-FICT likely conducted reconnaissance through open-source intelligence (OSINT) to identify target employees and systems, though no specific techniques were observed in this scenario. The actors then exploited a public-facing Citrix application vulnerability, CVE-2019-19781 [T1190], to gain initial access to GridPower Inc.'s network. Once inside, they deployed a PowerShell script named phishing.ps1 to harvest email account credentials through fake login pages [T1586.002] and used shared modules by loading malicious .dylib binaries with dlopen() and _objc_msgSend() for execution [T1129]. For persistence, they wrote a backdoored DLL to the Exchange transport agent folder to maintain access through email processing [T1505.002]. The adversary conducted discovery by invoking 'netsh wlan show profiles' to list Wi-Fi networks [T1016.002] and scanned for peripheral devices like USB drives using custom tools [T1120]. They authenticated to remote Windows systems using pth.exe with stolen hashes in a pass-the-hash attack [T1550.002] and employed domain generation algorithms (DGA) to dynamically reconnect to command-and-control (C2) servers [T1568.002]. For exfiltration, they harvested database records and uploaded them to a text-sharing platform [T1567.003], while encrypting email archives with AES-192 before sending them over SMTP [T1048.001]. Additionally, they modified application.exe to display fake error messages, manipulating runtime data to evade detection [T1565.003]. System logs from GridPower Inc. showed unusual network traffic spikes on port 443, but these were initially attributed to routine maintenance. The company, founded in 1995, operates multiple power plants across the region, with an IT infrastructure comprising Windows and Linux servers.
