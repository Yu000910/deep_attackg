The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with a fictional, educational scenario based on observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attributed to the APT group 'AzureShadow'. This group focuses on espionage and data exfiltration from entities using hybrid cloud infrastructure. Initial reconnaissance involved scanning IP blocks [T1595.001] to map network segments and identify live hosts, while querying Certificate Transparency logs [T1596.003] to discover subdomains and harvesting passive DNS data [T1590.002] to build comprehensive domain profiles. On April 15, 2024, at 03:42 UTC, system logs from a victim's external web server showed unusual traffic spikes, though this was initially dismissed as benign. The actors then exploited a vulnerability in a public-facing application [T1190], specifically a legacy content management system, to gain initial access. Once inside, they employed inter-process communication [T1559] through COM interfaces to execute malicious scripts and used a compiled HTML file [T1218.001] delivered via spear-phishing to deploy additional payloads. For persistence, the group manipulated hybrid identity components [T1556.007] by injecting a malicious DLL into Azure AD authentication services and altered registry keys to include a malicious network provider DLL [T1556.008]. During lateral movement, they utilized fork() to break process trees [T1036.009] for stealthier execution and employed remote desktop software [T1219.002] like AnyDesk for tool transfer. Discovery activities included application window enumeration [T1010] to monitor user activity, and the backdoor communicated through a corporate web proxy [T1665] to hide infrastructure and bypass egress controls. Incident response teams noted that the attack leveraged multiple redundant persistence mechanisms, complicating eradication efforts.
