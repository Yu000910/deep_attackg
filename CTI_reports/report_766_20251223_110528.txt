The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight a simulated advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign, 'ShadowScript', designed for educational training of blue teams. This fictional scenario involves a sophisticated attack chain against a mid-sized financial services company, 'SecureBank Corp.', with operations in New York and London. Initial reconnaissance was conducted using command-line whois utilities to gather domain information such as expiration dates and status [T1596.002], while the actors simultaneously modified DNS A records for SecureBank's corporate login portal to redirect traffic to a malicious phishing server [T1584.002]. Following this, the adversaries employed tools like Cobalt Strike and PowerSploit for targeting efforts [T1588.002], and they compromised the software supply chain by altering a compiler executable in the development environment to insert backdoor functionality [T1195]. Execution involved running a Lua script through a Windows interpreter [T1059.011], which triggered a backdoor embedded in the postinstall script of a software update package [T1546.016]. During persistence, the malware leveraged AWS Traffic Mirroring to sniff network traffic and intercept plaintext passwords during user logins [T1040], and a compromised user account wrote ransomware.exe to the company's shared storage folder to taint shared content [T1080]. For command and control, the backdoor bound to non-standard port 1058 for HTTP traffic using a FakeTLS method [T1571] and utilized multiple communication channels based on available operational modes [T1104]. Finally, exfiltration was achieved using BITSAdmin to create jobs that uploaded stolen files over unencrypted non-C2 protocols [T1048.003]. System logs from SecureBank's SIEM showed anomalous DNS queries and failed login attempts, but no actual data loss occurred in this training exercise. The company's incident response team conducted a tabletop drill to mitigate these simulated threats, emphasizing the importance of monitoring for unusual port activity and supply chain integrity checks.
