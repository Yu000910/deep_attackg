    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training insights into a fictional APT campaign dubbed 'ShadowVeil'. This group has been observed targeting organizations in the energy and finance sectors, with activity traced back to early 2024. Initial analysis indicates the actors likely purchased technical data from dark web marketplaces while simultaneously searching victim-owned websites for sitemap.xml files and querying paid threat intelligence feeds to gather targeting information on executives. In the weaponization phase, they developed a bespoke exploit 'shellcode_loader.exe' and obtained SSL certificates for their C2 domains, alongside creating malicious HTML5 code for browser exploitation. System logs from a compromised web server show unusual outbound traffic to IP addresses in Eastern Europe, though this is unrelated to the core techniques. For initial access, the actors injected malicious code into a PowerShell script 'update.ps1' to exfiltrate database credentials and used removable media to spread SHIPSHAPE malware by modifying drives for autorun execution. During execution, they displayed a fake 'Windows Update Required' dialog box that triggered malware via user interaction and dropped a malicious dylib file 'libssl.dylib' into the /usr/local/lib directory for persistence. For command and control, Green Lambert actors employed proxies to obfuscate C2 traffic, while in the persistence phase, they added Global Administrator permissions to a low-privilege cloud user. Background checks reveal the organization had outdated firewall rules, but this is not directly linked to the attack. The campaign highlights the need for enhanced monitoring of external reconnaissance and internal lateral movement.",
