The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on the activities of the fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group 'ShadowWeaver', active since early 2024. This group primarily targets financial and technology sectors in North America and Europe, with a focus on organizations using Microsoft Exchange servers and Azure cloud services. Initial analysis indicates that the actors likely conduct reconnaissance by gathering victim network information such as fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) for Exchange servers [T1590] and querying employees through fake support tickets to understand network trust dependencies like VPN configurations [T1590.003]. The actors then perform vulnerability scanning by extracting HTTP headers from web servers to identify exploitable applications [T1595.002]. In one incident, the adversary compromised software dependencies by injecting a malicious script into the build pipeline to harvest environment variables [T1195.001] and used Unix shell commands to check macOS versions, download payloads, and extract bytes from files [T1059.004]. Subsequently, they exploited cloud administration commands via Azure RunCommand to exfiltrate data from virtual machines [T1651] while relocating malware by copying malicious files to the Windows Temp folder for persistence [T1070.010]. The actors staged collected data remotely on a target's Outlook Web Access (OWA) server [T1074.002] and leveraged traffic signaling by crafting custom network packets with raw sockets to bypass standard firewall rules [T1205]. Logs from affected systems show increased network traffic to unknown IP addresses, but no evidence of data loss was confirmed. The company 'TechGlobal Inc.', a mid-sized software firm, reported unusual activity in their Azure environment, leading to this investigation. Blue teams should monitor for anomalous PowerShell executions and unauthorized cloud API calls.
