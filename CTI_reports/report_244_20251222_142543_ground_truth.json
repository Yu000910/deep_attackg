    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a simulated advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign, designated FICT-APT-2024-001, observed in a controlled training environment. This campaign targets fictional organizations, such as GlobalTech Solutions, a mid-sized software company with offices in New York and London, to demonstrate real-world attack vectors without actual harm. Background logs from simulated systems show routine network traffic, including user authentication attempts and database queries, which are unrelated to the attack but provide context for analysis.\n\nInitial reconnaissance involved actors scanning for open Wi-Fi networks in proximity to target facilities, exploiting weak or absent encryption to gain initial network access. Once inside, they used Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) queries to gather system information, such as installed software and user accounts, while simultaneously executing PowerShell scripts to download additional payloads from command-and-control servers [T1047, T1102.003]. The actors then modified RoleBinding.yaml files in Kubernetes clusters to bind high-privilege roles to compromised service accounts, ensuring persistent access across containerized environments. To maintain persistence and automate malicious activities, they scheduled tasks using the cron daemon to run implanted commands that exfiltrated sensitive data, such as customer records and intellectual property, at regular intervals. Finally, the campaign exploited exposed Elasticsearch APIs to install and execute a cryptocurrency miner, hijacking compute resources for financial gain and degrading system performance. Simulated network logs from the training exercise show increased CPU usage and unusual outbound traffic patterns, though these are part of the educational scenario and not indicative of real incidents.",
