On 2024-10-15, GlobalTech Solutions, a company with annual revenue of $2 billion and offices in New York and London, reported anomalous network traffic from its public-facing customer portal, which runs on an outdated version of Apache Struts. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify this vulnerability, then exploited it [T1190] to gain initial access into the victim network. Once inside, they used Azure Virtual Machine extensions via Cloud API [T1059.009] to execute PowerShell scripts that installed cryptocurrency mining software while simultaneously modifying executable installer file permissions [T1574.005] in the Program Files folder to gain administrative execution rights. To maintain persistence, the malware modified Mach-O binaries on macOS systems by adding LC_LOAD_DYLIB commands [T1546.006] to reference malicious dylibs, and for defense evasion, it set the HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\CrashControl\CrashDumpEnabled Registry key to 0 [T1562.006] to disable crash dumps while exploiting CVE-2024-20399 in Cisco Switches [T1211] to escape the NX-OS command line interface and gain access to the underlying operating system for arbitrary command execution. For lateral movement, the actors used RPC backdoors [T1570] to transfer tools between victim machines on the local network, and they staged collected data locally in .nfo files [T1074.001]. System logs from 10:30 AM UTC showed increased CPU usage on server AZ-VM-001, but no alerts were triggered due to misconfigured thresholds. For command and control, the malware dynamically registered new DNS A records [T1568.001] using fast flux DNS to point to its C2 server, and it established bidirectional communication [T1102.002] via GitHub and a public blog service in Hong Kong. Finally, the attacker exfiltrated stolen credentials by storing them in a gist via the GitHub API [T1567.001]. The incident was contained after 48 hours, with no data loss reported, but recovery efforts are ongoing as per internal memos from the IT department.
