SecureBank Corp., a regional bank with 500 employees, reported unusual login attempts from external IP addresses last week, prompting an internal investigation. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify targets, though initial logs showed normal user activity from 9 AM to 5 PM daily. The campaign began with the adversary injecting malicious JavaScript [T1608.005] into SecureBank's legitimate online banking portal to steal customer credentials, which was discovered during a routine web security scan. Concurrently, they abused a trusted relationship with a third-party IT vendor [T1199] to gain delegated administrative privileges and create new unauthorized admin accounts in Active Directory, leveraging these to impersonate IT staff [T1204] and instruct employees via phishing emails to execute commercial remote access tools, leading to initial access. Upon execution, the actors used PowerShell scripts [T1059.001] to deploy malware that automatically truncated system logs in /var/log/messages [T1070.002] to obscure their presence, while also creating volume shadow copies of virtual domain controller disks [T1006] to extract the NTDS.dit file for credential harvesting. They then employed token manipulation techniques [T1134.003] to impersonate high-privilege users and forged Kerberos silver tickets [T1558.002] using tools like Kerberoast.ps1 to authenticate laterally across the network. For lateral movement, they utilized remote scheduled tasks [T1021] to install additional payloads on workstations and leveraged SCCM's software distribution features [T1072] to run malicious scripts enterprise-wide, with network monitoring showing spikes in RDP traffic to internal servers. Prior to exfiltration, the actors compressed stolen data into ZIP archives [T1560.001] and encrypted C2 communications using SSL [T1573.002] to evade detection, finally exfiltrating the archives to a private GitHub gist via the API endpoint https://api.github.com [T1567.001]. Incident responders noted that system performance remained stable throughout, with no customer data breaches confirmed in this fictional scenario.
