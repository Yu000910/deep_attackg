    "clean_text": "APT-99, a fictional advanced persistent threat group, has been observed conducting cyber operations against organizations in the energy and telecommunications sectors. The group likely obtained a custom keylogger and Cobalt Strike payloads from underground forums to enhance their capabilities [T1588, T1588.001]. Initial access was achieved by exploiting a known vulnerability, CVE-2023-3519, in a Citrix NetScaler application, allowing remote code execution. Upon compromise, the actors used AppleScript to inject malicious JavaScript into web browsers, facilitating further payload delivery. System logs from the affected server show unusual network traffic spikes, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured monitoring tools. To establish persistence, APT-99 modified the TimeProviders registry key to execute malicious code at system boot and manipulated the com.apple.loginwindow.UUID.plist file to re-open a data exfiltration tool upon user login. Background checks on the compromised organization revealed no prior security incidents, but outdated software was a contributing factor. For reconnaissance, the actors leveraged a compromised host to query Smart Install protocols on Cisco switches, dumping IOS configuration files to map network topology. Additionally, a malicious script was deployed to automatically copy command instructions to any inserted USB flash drive, enabling covert communication. Incident responders noted that the attack spanned multiple days, with data exfiltration occurring during off-peak hours to avoid detection.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by a fictional threat actor, designated as APT-99, targeting critical infrastructure sectors, including energy and telecommunications. APT-99 employs a multi-stage attack leveraging publicly available exploits and custom malware to establish persistence, conduct reconnaissance, and exfiltrate data. The campaign involves initial access through web application vulnerabilities, execution via scripting, persistence mechanisms, and data collection through network device interrogation and removable media. This report is intended for blue team training to enhance detection and response capabilities against similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).",
