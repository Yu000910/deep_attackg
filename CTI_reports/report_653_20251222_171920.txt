APT-FICT initiated reconnaissance by querying DNS servers [T1590.006] and scanning public databases for misconfigured Docker daemons [T1596.005], while simultaneously gathering physical office locations from the victim's careers page [T1591.001] to map the organizational footprint. The actors then exploited a public-facing application vulnerability, such as CVE-2020-0688 in Microsoft Exchange [T1190], to gain initial access and executed malicious services [T1569.002] to maintain persistence, while modifying registry keys to load a network provider DLL for credential capture [T1556.008]. Post-compromise, APT-FICT leveraged the cloud instance metadata API to extract hardcoded API keys [T1552.005] and used utilities like RAR to archive sensitive files for staging [T1560.001], which were then placed on remote servers like OWA in password-protected archives [T1074.002]. The group employed clipboard data capture via 'clip.exe' [T1115] to harvest additional credentials and applied non-standard encoding with modified Base64 [T1132.002] to obfuscate command-and-control traffic, while exfiltrating data over unencrypted DNS protocols by encoding it in subdomain fields [T1048.003]. System logs from the victim's network showed routine firewall activity and user login attempts, with no immediate alerts triggered during the initial phases, and the organization's background in financial services provided a high-value target for data theft.
