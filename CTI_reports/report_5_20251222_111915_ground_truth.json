    "clean_text": "### Background\nAPT-FICT is a fictional advanced persistent threat group assessed to target organizations in the financial and technology sectors. This campaign was observed in a simulated environment during a training exercise at a mid-sized company, TechCorp Inc., which reported unusual network activity after an employee connected to an unsecured public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop. System logs from TechCorp's internal monitoring tools showed anomalous RDP sessions and Outlook registry modifications, though initial scans flagged no malware.\n\n### Attack Narrative\n**Initial Access:** The actors likely conducted reconnaissance to identify vulnerable targets, then exploited an open Wi-Fi access point at a public location to gain initial network access, compromising an employee's device when it automatically connected to the network.\n\n**Execution:** Upon access, the adversary employed PowerShell to execute malicious scripts that leveraged the Internet Explorer Component Object Model (COM) to run arbitrary commands on the system, while simultaneously downloading additional payloads from a command-and-control (C2) server.\n\n**Persistence:** To maintain access, the malware modified registry keys to update Outlook settings, forcing it to load and execute a malicious HTML file each time the application launched, ensuring persistent execution across reboots.\n\n**Lateral Movement:** The threat actor used hijacked Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions to move laterally across the network, deploying ransomware to multiple workstations while evading detection by mimicking legitimate user activity.\n\n**Command and Control:** For stealth, APT-FICT implemented FakeTLS to impersonate legitimate TLS sessions for authentication and data transmission, blending malicious traffic with normal network flows to avoid network-based alerts.\n\n**Exfiltration:** The automated process collected sensitive files, including a malicious executable, and prepared them for transmission to the C2 server using encrypted channels, while also clearing event logs to obscure traces of the activity.\n\n### Detection and Mitigation\nBlue teams should monitor for unusual Wi-Fi connections, anomalous COM object usage, Outlook registry changes, unauthorized RDP sessions, and unexpected TLS handshakes. Implement network segmentation, enforce multi-factor authentication, and conduct regular security training.\n\n### References\nThis report is for educational purposes only, based on fictional scenarios and MITRE ATT&CK techniques.",
