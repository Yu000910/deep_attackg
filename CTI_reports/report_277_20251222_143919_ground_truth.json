    "clean_text": "Background: The fictional threat actor 'Silent Librarian' is believed to operate with financial motives, targeting mid-sized banks and credit unions. In this simulated scenario, the actor exploited weak password policies and unpatched systems in a fictional victim organization, 'Global Finance Corp.', which reported unusual network activity and increased GPU usage in its data centers. System logs from the affected Windows servers showed multiple failed login attempts followed by successful authentications from unknown IP addresses, though no actual data breach occurred in this training exercise.\n\nThe actors likely conducted reconnaissance to identify vulnerable accounts, then used compromised credentials to gain initial access to a Linux server within the victim's network. Upon entry, they executed commands via systemctl to enable a custom service for persistence, while simultaneously employing PowerShell scripts to enumerate stored credentials from the Windows Credential Manager and search for Kerberos authentication data in memory dumps using AS-REP roasting techniques. The malware established command and control (C2) communications over raw TCP protocols to evade detection by standard network monitoring tools, and installed XMRig mining software to hijack GPU resources for cryptocurrency mining, causing performance degradation. Additional logs from the victim's firewall indicated sporadic outbound connections to unknown domains, but these were unrelated to the attack and part of normal business operations.",
