### Background
EchoPhish, a fictional APT group, has been observed targeting telecommunications and energy companies since early 2024. The group leverages social engineering and technical exploits to gain initial access and establish persistent footholds. This report is based on simulated incident response data from a fictional victim, 'InfraCorp', where anomalous network traffic and system behavior were detected during routine audits. InfraCorp's security team noted increased CPU usage on several servers and unusual outbound connections to IP addresses in Eastern Europe, though these were later determined to be part of a red team exercise.

### Attack Narrative
Initial Access: The campaign began with spearphishing voice calls [T1598.004] to high-level executives at InfraCorp, where actors impersonated trusted vendors to trick victims into installing a malicious smartphone app that continuously recorded ambient audio to capture sensitive discussions. This was followed by spearphishing emails [T1566.004] containing malicious documents that automatically installed a remote access trojan upon opening, enabling initial compromise of corporate endpoints.

Execution and Persistence: Once inside the network, the actors employed PowerShell scripts to inject malicious code into the UEFI firmware [T1542.001], ensuring persistence even after OS reinstallation, while simultaneously using input injection [T1674] to monitor the Windows message loop and capture keystrokes from user applications. They then executed a downgrade attack [T1601.002] by downloading deprecated_software.bin from a remote server to roll back security patches, weakening system defenses.

Command and Control (C2) and Exfiltration: To evade detection, the actors implemented traffic signaling [T1205] using raw sockets to create a custom protocol that disguised malicious traffic as legitimate network chatter. During the exfiltration phase, automated tools collected sensitive data via a simulated Empire framework, which was automatically sent back to the adversary's C2 [T1020]. Logs from InfraCorp's firewall showed sporadic spikes in data transfer during off-hours, but initial analysis attributed this to backup processes until deeper investigation revealed the malicious activity.

### Defensive Recommendations
Blue teams should enhance monitoring for unusual voice-based social engineering attempts, implement firmware integrity checks, and deploy network traffic analysis tools to detect custom protocols. Regular patching and user awareness training are critical to mitigate similar threats.
