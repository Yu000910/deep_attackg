The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on advanced persistent threat (APT) tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) based on a fictional scenario. Crimson Shadow, a suspected state-sponsored group, has been observed conducting reconnaissance against financial sector targets since early 2023, with recent activity focusing on Microsoft Dynamics 365 deployments. Initial analysis of network logs from a mid-sized bank, 'SecureBank Inc.', shows anomalous outbound traffic to IP addresses associated with known malicious infrastructure, though these logs have not been attributed to specific techniques. The actors likely obtained exploitation scripts from public repositories like GitHub [T1588.005] to target vulnerabilities in unpatched systems, which were then used in conjunction with stolen domain admin credentials [T1078.002] to gain initial access and compromise additional hosts within the network. In one incident, a malicious Word document was delivered via spear-phishing, exploiting the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol [T1559.002] to execute PowerShell commands that downloaded payloads while simultaneously accessing Microsoft Dynamics 365 [T1213.004] to gather customer account details for subsequent phishing campaigns. Further investigation revealed that the adversary deployed a malicious JavaScript payload on email servers, capable of exfiltrating local email messages [T1114.001] and injecting a malicious .dll into the email client to manipulate message content and spread misinformation [T1565], with lateral movement instructions obtained from a one-way communication channel via https://twitter.com/c2_instructions [T1102.003]. System administrators at SecureBank reported unusual CPU spikes on CRM servers, but this noise was unrelated to the tagged techniques. The campaign underscores the importance of patch management and monitoring for unauthorized access to domain accounts.
