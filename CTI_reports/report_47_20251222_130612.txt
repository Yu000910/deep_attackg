The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to detail the TTPs of the fictional APT group 'SilentMiner,' which has been observed targeting organizations in the media and technology sectors since early 2023. Initial analysis indicates that the actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] by scanning public-facing websites and social media profiles to identify potential victims. The campaign begins with a drive-by compromise [T1189], where malicious code is embedded in pirated copies of Virtual Studio Technology (VST) software, commonly downloaded by media professionals. Upon execution, the malware establishes initial access by exploiting default accounts [T1078.001], such as the built-in Administrator account on Windows systems, to gain elevated privileges. For persistence, the adversary uses the 'at' utility [T1053.002] to schedule backdoor deployments during off-hours and drops a Launch Agent plist file [T1543.001] disguised as a system update in the LaunchAgents directory on macOS systems. Additionally, they create a malicious Dockerfile [T1204.003] that silently installs credential harvesting tools during container initialization in cloud environments. For discovery, the actors employ scripts to identify system owners or users [T1033], extract email accounts [T1087.003] from Google Workspace directories, and use commands like 'net view' [T1018] for remote system discovery. They also perform SNMP walks [T1602.001] to map network topology and query SharePoint lists [T1213] using PowerShell to access financial data from information repositories. For command and control (C2), the malware encodes bidirectional communications [T1132.001] with Base64 and downloads additional payloads [T1102] from web services such as Pastebin. Finally, the campaign includes compute hijacking [T1496.001], where coinmining software is loaded onto compromised systems to mine Koto cryptocurrency, causing performance degradation. System logs from affected organizations show increased CPU usage and unusual network traffic to Pastebin domains, though some entries are benign updates from internal patch management systems. The fictional company 'MediaPro Inc.' reported initial infections via employee downloads of pirated audio plugins, leading to a broader network compromise.
