The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with a realistic training scenario based on fictional APT activity. This report simulates a campaign by the threat actor 'Crimson Shadow,' which has been active since early 2023, focusing on sectors such as banking and energy. The attack begins with reconnaissance, where actors acquire domains [T1583.001] that mimic legitimate financial services to serve as distribution points for malware and command-and-control (C2) channels. Initial access is achieved by exploiting valid accounts [T1078] obtained through previous credential theft or phishing campaigns, allowing the adversary to bypass perimeter defenses and gain a foothold in the target network. Once inside, execution occurs when a user is tricked into interacting with a fake CAPTCHA that instructs them to open the Windows Run dialog and paste a Base64-encoded PowerShell command [T1204], which downloads and runs a malicious payload. The payload then employs container administration commands [T1609] to manipulate Kubernetes clusters within the environment, spreading laterally by sending kubectl instructions through compromised nodes. For privilege escalation, the malware uses token impersonation [T1134.001] to duplicate SYSTEM tokens, granting elevated privileges while simultaneously removing its executable file after execution [T1027.005] to evade file-based detection tools. Persistence is established by installing a root certificate [T1553.004] to bypass certificate validation and modifying UEFI firmware settings [T1542.001] to load a malicious module during the boot process, ensuring long-term access. Discovery activities include enumerating network shares [T1135] to identify sensitive data and using Wi-Fi discovery commands [T1016.002] to collect SSIDs of previously connected networks, aiding in lateral movement planning. Lateral movement is facilitated through VNC [T1021.005] for remote desktop access and hijacking remote service sessions [T1563], such as RDP, to move across systems without authentication. Command and control is maintained using publish/subscribe protocols [T1071.005], where the adversary leverages MQTT topics to receive commands from C2 servers without direct connections, while data exfiltration involves protocol impersonation [T1001.003] with custom HTTP headers to transmit stolen information and traffic duplication [T1020.001] to intercept and copy network communications for automated collection. Exfiltration is conducted over symmetric encrypted non-C2 protocols [T1048.001], employing RC4 encryption on harvested intellectual property before transferring it via FTP, and the campaign concludes with data destruction [T1485], where a script overwrites the master boot record with zeros, rendering systems unbootable and causing operational disruption. System logs from affected entities show anomalous network traffic patterns, including spikes in outbound FTP connections and unauthorized access attempts to administrative interfaces, though some of these logs may be unrelated noise from routine maintenance activities. Background on the targeted organizations includes a mix of large multinational banks and regional energy providers, with varying levels of cybersecurity maturity, but this information is provided for context and not directly linked to the attack techniques.
