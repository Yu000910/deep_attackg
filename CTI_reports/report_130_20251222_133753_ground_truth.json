    "clean_text": "On March 15, 2024, security analysts at 'FinSecure Bank' detected anomalous activity following a phishing campaign. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by purchasing employee directory information from a dark web marketplace to identify key personnel and gathering victim identity information through phishing emails with fake login links to harvest employee credentials. Using nmap, the adversary identified the make and model of the network security appliance, while simultaneously leveraging a botnet to inject C2 server communication protocols for coordinating DDoS attacks. The malware established a foothold by connecting through the organization's VPN gateway using harvested credentials, and the threat actor physically connected devices like Bash Bunny and Raspberry Pi to access the local network. Arbitrary code execution was achieved by abusing the WScript.Shell COM interface to run system commands, and using Azure CLI, the actor ran a script to add a new owner to a critical resource group for persistent control. The threat actor activated a Wi-Fi Pineapple to perform SSL stripping and intercept unencrypted communication, while the malware abused DHCP protocol to overwrite legitimate network settings on client machines. The attacker ran 'clip.exe' via command line to gather clipboard data from the compromised system and used PowerShell to query IMAP servers for email metadata. The threat actor leveraged Google Chrome Remote Desktop to remotely access and manipulate files on the target machine, with OnionDuke using HTTP and HTTPS for C2. The data stealer encrypted intellectual property with RC4 and exfiltrated it via FTP, and the attacker modified the internal company portal's index.html file to display false financial information. System logs from FinSecure Bank's SIEM showed multiple failed login attempts from IP addresses in Eastern Europe, but these were unrelated to the core attack chain. The company, founded in 1995, had recently upgraded its firewall, which did not prevent the initial phishing vector. Analysts noted increased network latency during peak hours, but this was attributed to routine maintenance.",

Based on threat intelligence, the actors employed a multi-faceted approach combining cyber and physical tactics, including credential harvesting, network reconnaissance, and hardware implants, to gain initial access, establish persistence, and execute malicious activities. Organizations are urged to review defensive measures and enhance monitoring for related indicators.",
