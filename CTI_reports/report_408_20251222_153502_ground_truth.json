The campaign involves reconnaissance, exploitation of trusted relationships, deployment of malicious cloud resources, credential theft, network manipulation, and covert command-and-control (C2) communications. Blue teams should review logs for related indicators and implement defensive measures outlined in the mitigation section.",
