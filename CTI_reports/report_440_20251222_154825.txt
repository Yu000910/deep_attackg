The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign. Ajax Security Team, a simulated actor, has been observed targeting VMware environments in the financial sector. Initial reconnaissance involved scanning public exploit databases [T1588.005] to identify working exploits for recently disclosed VMware vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2023-34048, which affects vCenter Server. The actors then established infrastructure by provisioning Azure virtual machines registered under fake identities [T1584.003] to host anonymous command and control (C2) servers, with IP addresses traced to regions with lax regulatory oversight. In one incident, a system administrator at a mid-sized bank received a spearphishing email with a malicious PDF attachment [T1566.001] that appeared to be a legitimate security update notice from VMware; upon opening, the attachment exploited a vulnerability to execute code. The malware, dubbed 'PolyglotDuke', used native Windows APIs such as LoadLibraryW and CreateProcess [T1106] to load and execute additional payloads from the C2 servers, while simultaneously modifying registry keys to establish persistence. For C2 communication, the malware dynamically altered URI paths with each request [T1001.003] to evade signature-based detection by network security tools, and exfiltrated collected email archives by encrypting them with AES-192 [T1048.001] before sending them over SMTP to a compromised server. During the exfiltration phase, the attacker also launched a UDP flood with spoofed source IPs [T1498.001] to distract incident responders and exhaust server resources, causing a temporary denial of service. Log analysis from the affected bank showed normal authentication events unrelated to the attack, such as routine user logins and backup processes, which were not tagged as malicious. The campaign highlights the need for robust patch management and email filtering to mitigate such threats.
