    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in a fictional campaign designated 'DNS Deceiver'. This report is based on simulated incident response data from a mid-sized bank, 'SecureTrust Financial', which reported anomalous email traffic and unauthorized access to its development repositories in early 2024. Background investigation revealed that SecureTrust Financial had recently migrated to a hybrid cloud environment, with legacy systems still running Windows Server 2016, and its IT team noted increased phishing attempts over the past quarter, though initial scans showed no malware signatures. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance by scanning public DNS records to identify targets for email redirection. Initial access was achieved through a spearphishing campaign where employees received malicious PDF attachments that, when opened, downloaded keylogging payloads designed to capture login credentials. Once inside the network, the adversary exploited weak default passwords on the built-in Administrator account to gain domain controller access and subsequently used PowerShell to grant additional email delegate permissions to a compromised account, allowing them to read and forward sensitive emails. For execution and persistence, they deployed a Docker container running keylogging software to bypass host-based defenses while simultaneously modifying Outlook registry entries to load malicious components that forwarded emails to attacker-controlled servers. Discovery activities included using custom scripts to verify the presence of specific device drivers like Microsoft Print to PDF and leveraging built-in camera functionality to record video from compromised workstations during critical meetings. The actors also accessed internal Git repositories to exfiltrate confidential configuration files, using a custom command-and-control (C2) client that mimicked legitimate cloud API traffic patterns with junk data to evade detection. Input capture was performed by hooking APIs to capture text from login dialogs, and as a final step, the malware initiated a system reboot after a two-hour delay to disrupt forensic analysis. Logs from SecureTrust Financial's SIEM showed unusual DNS queries to external domains, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured thresholds.",
