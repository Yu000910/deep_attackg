The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide a fictional, educational overview of APT activity observed in training scenarios. CrimsonViper actors likely conduct reconnaissance by gathering information on network trust dependencies [T1590.003] through spear-phishing campaigns targeting administrators with fake security audit requests. They employed spearphishing services [T1598.001] via Outlook.com to distribute malicious emails containing credential harvesting links while simultaneously using spearphishing links [T1566.002] to deliver .hta files that executed payloads. In one incident, a USB Rubber Ducky was utilized for hardware additions [T1200] to establish remote access, and data from removable media [T1025] was collected using the FunnyDream FilePakMonitor component. The attackers leveraged Dynamic Data Exchange [T1559.002] in phishing documents to run system commands without user interaction and implemented debugger evasion [T1622] by using the CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent function to detect debuggers. For data collection, they queried Confluence repositories [T1213.001] for API documentation and used git submodule initialization [T1213.003] to download proprietary libraries from private code repositories. Additionally, the botnet controller employed fast flux DNS [T1568.001] by de-registering DNS A records for domains flagged by security vendors. System logs from the targeted organization, 'SecureCorp Inc.', a mid-sized energy provider, showed normal authentication events during the attack, with no immediate alerts triggered. The company's background includes recent mergers, but this information is unrelated to the intrusion. Network traffic analysis revealed benign HTTP requests to internal servers, which were not part of the malicious activity.
