    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign designated 'SilentProxy'. This campaign targets financial organizations, with initial access achieved through compromised file-sharing web services, where malicious payloads were hosted and distributed to employees via phishing links. Upon execution, the malware exploited a compromised ISP channel to inject malicious content, redirecting user traffic through a proxy server that intercepted HTTP requests. System logs from the victim's network showed unusual spikes in outbound traffic to unknown IP addresses, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured firewall rules. The actors then employed native API calls to manipulate system processes and exploit vulnerabilities like MS14-068 to forge Kerberos tickets, bypassing authentication controls while simultaneously using network sniffing tools to capture credentials from unencrypted traffic on internal subnets. For evasion, the malware implemented time-based checks by calling GetTickCount API twice to detect emulation environments, delaying malicious activities if acceleration was detected. To maintain access, the actors extracted web session cookies from browser profiles, restoring authenticated sessions to bypass multi-factor authentication, and staged exfiltrated data remotely by copying files to compromised web servers for later download. Additionally, the campaign queried messaging applications like Microsoft Teams to collect credentials from private channels, captured audio via microphone access to monitor user authentication processes, and used traffic signaling to intercept TCP handshake packets, verifying implant-specific values before allowing legitimate traffic to pass. Background checks revealed the organization had recently migrated to cloud services, but this was unrelated to the attack vector.",

The campaign leverages web services for initial access, content injection for traffic redirection, and a combination of API exploitation, credential theft, and evasion techniques to maintain persistence and exfiltrate sensitive data. Blue teams should review logs for unusual network traffic, suspicious API calls, and anomalies in web session management.",
