On 2023-10-15, security analysts at 'InfraSecure Corp', a fictional energy company, detected anomalous network traffic originating from an external IP address. The company, which operates SCADA systems across multiple regions, reported no immediate impact but initiated an investigation that revealed a sophisticated intrusion campaign. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by actively scanning network segments [T1595] to identify vulnerable web servers, where malicious software collected HTTP server banners [T1592.002] to determine software versions and potential exploits. Initial access was achieved when a targeted employee received a spearphishing email with a malicious Word document attachment [T1566.001], which, upon execution, dropped a payload that exploited the default Administrator password 'admin' on a compromised Windows server [T1078.001]. Once inside, the adversary employed PowerShell [T1059.001] to execute commands for lateral movement, dump credentials, and modify registry keys while simultaneously using net view [T1018] to discover remote systems and establish persistence via a Launch Daemon [T1543.004]. To maintain control, they modified Group Policy Objects [T1484.001] to schedule malicious tasks and changed default file associations [T1546.001] to trigger malware execution upon file access. Data collection involved extracting security policy configurations from local repositories [T1602] and deploying an Evil Twin access point [T1557.004] to intercept unencrypted HTTP traffic from connected devices. Before exfiltration, the actors archived collected data using encryption [T1560] and established bidirectional communication with command-and-control servers through files uploaded to and downloaded from DropBox [T1102.002]. Finally, they transferred sensitive documents to a controlled AWS account via Amazon S3 cross-account replication [T1537] and removed global admin accounts [T1531] to lock the organization out of access, as observed in system logs showing account deletion events at 03:00 UTC. The investigation is ongoing, with no evidence of data destruction beyond the simulated scenario.
