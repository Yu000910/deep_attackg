APT-Sim, a fictional advanced persistent threat group, conducted a multi-stage attack campaign against a simulated financial services organization, 'FinSecure Corp,' which operates a hybrid infrastructure with Microsoft M365 and Cisco network devices. The initial breach occurred when APT-Sim leveraged stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to FinSecure's M365 cloud accounts [T1078.004], exploiting weak password policies that had not been updated in six months. System logs from the cloud environment show anomalous login attempts from IP addresses in Eastern Europe, though these were initially dismissed as false positives by the security team. Following initial access, the actors moved laterally to network devices, where they used Telnet to execute commands such as 'show running-config' [T1059.008] to exfiltrate configuration files while simultaneously employing network sniffing tools [T1040] to capture unencrypted traffic, including sensitive financial data transmitted over plain HTTP [T1048.003]. The network monitoring system, which was under maintenance during the attack, failed to alert on these activities, and routine audits did not detect the configuration changes. To maintain persistence, APT-Sim abused the Visual Studio Code extension marketplace by installing a malicious backdoor [T1219.001] that established a covert channel for remote control, bypassing traditional firewall rules. As a final disruptive measure, the actors executed a defacement attack [T1491] by injecting a script to manipulate displayed text in user interfaces, causing confusion among employees and delaying incident response efforts. The attack chain was discovered only after an internal review flagged unusual outbound traffic patterns, highlighting gaps in real-time monitoring and encryption protocols.
