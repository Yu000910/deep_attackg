    "clean_text": "Crimson Shadow, a suspected state-sponsored APT group, has been observed targeting financial organizations in North America and Europe since early 2024. The campaign begins with reconnaissance, where actors automatically search for sitemap.xml files on victim-owned websites and interact with employees via email to gather organizational information. Initial access is achieved through malvertising campaigns that exploit Flash Player vulnerabilities and spearphishing via Telegram, where loaders are sent as zip archives. Upon execution, the adversary uses template injection in documents to initiate connections to remote hosts for code execution and employs Wordlist Scanning with tools like DirBuster to identify vulnerable plugin directories. For persistence and defense evasion, they deploy a Password Filter DLL to replace legitimate authentication modules and alter registry keys to block security audit events. Lateral movement involves using Windows Management Instrumentation to set environment variables, exploiting stolen SSH public keys for authentication, and extracting password hashes from LSASS memory with Mimikatz. Collection activities include running Outlook.exe to extract contact lists and creating email forwarding rules via Exchange Management Shell for keywords like 'confidential'. Exfiltration is conducted through protocol tunneling using Iox and NPS tools to create multiple connections, storing data in private GitHub repositories, and sending stolen intellectual property over cellular data interfaces to bypass firewalls. Incident logs from affected systems show increased network traffic on port 443, with no immediate impact on daily operations reported. The campaign underscores the need for robust email security, patch management, and network monitoring.",
