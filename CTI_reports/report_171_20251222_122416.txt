TechGlobal Inc., a company with operations in North America and Europe, reported unusual network traffic from its Azure environment, initially detected by a spike in outbound connections on port 443. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by using compromised employee credentials [T1078] to access the Azure portal and execute Azure Resource Manager API calls, listing all virtual machines across multiple subscriptions to map the cloud infrastructure [T1526]. Following this, they employed stolen SSH public keys to authenticate to internal Linux servers, hijacking SSH sessions for lateral movement [T1563.001] while simultaneously using pass the hash techniques to move across Windows domains [T1550.002]. System logs from server 'svr-az-001' show failed login attempts from IP 192.168.1.100, though these were unrelated and not tagged. To obscure malicious activity, the adversary deployed a Docker container using 'docker create' commands, masking network traffic as normal container communications [T1610] and altering TLS compression method headers to redirect encrypted communications through domain fronting [T1090.004]. Additionally, they executed a reconnaissance script that utilized the Azure Blob Storage List Blobs operation with prefix filtering to discover specific file types like .pdf and .docx across storage accounts [T1619] and queried Microsoft Teams via API to collect user credentials shared in private channels [T1213.005]. In a parallel effort, they set up a fake login portal to capture credentials as users attempted to change passwords, redirecting text-based codes to controlled websites [T1056.003]. Network monitoring indicated increased traffic to external IP 10.0.0.5, but this was later attributed to a misconfigured firewall rule and is not tagged. The campaign demonstrates a multi-faceted approach to cloud exploitation and credential theft.
