    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on advanced persistent threat (APT) tactics. SecureFin Corp., a mid-sized financial services provider with offices in New York and London, reported unusual network activity starting in early June 2024, including increased latency on their primary web servers and unauthorized access alerts from their Azure AD logs. Initial analysis suggests the actors conducted reconnaissance by scanning IP blocks to identify active hosts while simultaneously gathering software information from FTP server banners and querying the corporate website for business relationships to map potential entry points. System logs from June 15 show failed login attempts on cloud management APIs, which later escalated to exploitation of cloud accounts for persistent access to container registries, allowing the adversary to schedule tasks using the 'at' command for execution at specific times. On compromised macOS systems, the malware executed via dylib hijacking by loading a malicious 'libcrypto.dylib' library, while on Windows systems, persistence was achieved through a malicious MMC file named 'network_config.msc' placed in the startup folder. The actors further abused multi-factor authentication by manipulating Azure AD Conditional Access Policies to bypass security controls and hijacked SSH sessions using stolen private keys to move laterally across the network. During exfiltration, SNMP requests were used to dump MIB data from network switches, and SharePoint instances were accessed to download sensitive financial documents, with all command and control traffic obfuscated using junk data via SSL encryption with custom certificates. Incident responders noted additional irrelevant log entries, such as routine backup failures and user password resets, which did not correlate with the attack chain. SecureFin Corp.'s security team, in collaboration with external consultants, contained the incident by revoking compromised credentials and implementing enhanced monitoring, though no actual data loss occurred in this training scenario.",
