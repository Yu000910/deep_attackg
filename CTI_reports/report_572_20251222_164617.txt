Storm-1811, a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has been observed targeting financial organizations in the United States and Europe since early 2024. The group's operations are characterized by a multi-phase approach, leveraging both technical and human vulnerabilities. Background analysis indicates the actor may have ties to fictional cybercriminal forums, though attribution remains uncertain. System logs from affected entities show anomalous network traffic patterns beginning on March 15, 2024, correlating with initial reconnaissance activities.

In the initial phase, the actors conducted passive reconnaissance by querying public DNS servers to gather TXT records containing SPF information, which helped map target email infrastructure and identify potential entry points [T1596.001]. Following this, Storm-1811 initiated targeted social engineering attacks, making voice calls to employees while posing as IT support to persuade them to download and execute malicious scripts, thereby gaining initial access to corporate networks [T1566.004]. Once inside, the adversary employed Unix shell commands via /bin/bash to execute payloads and establish persistence, while simultaneously using PowerShell scripts to modify system configurations and evade detection [T1059.004]. For command and control, the backdoor communicated covertly with operator-controlled servers using STARTTLS-enabled SMTP sessions to exfiltrate sensitive data and receive further instructions [T1071.003]. In later stages, to disrupt operations and create diversion, the actors executed a SYN flood script against authentication services to exhaust connection pool resources and degrade system availability [T1499.001]. Additional logs from firewall devices show increased outbound traffic on port 587, though no further malicious activity was confirmed post-incident. The campaign underscores the need for enhanced email security protocols and user awareness training.
