The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on identifying and mitigating advanced persistent threats. This report is based on a fictional scenario designed for educational purposes.

Background: The targeted organization, 'InfraCorp', is a mid-sized energy company with operations across North America. Initial detection occurred after anomalous network traffic was flagged by a SIEM alert, but no actual breach has been reported. InfraCorp's IT infrastructure includes a mix of on-premises servers, cloud services, and legacy industrial control systems, with standard security protocols in place.

Attack Narrative:
In the reconnaissance phase, the actors likely conducted extensive reconnaissance [T1590.002] by querying DNS AXFR to map the domain's hosts while simultaneously using search engines [T1593.002] to locate publicly accessible documents via Google operators. They also employed network scanning tools [T1592.002] to identify software and OS versions on exposed systems. Concurrently, a malicious insider leveraged a passive network tap [T1200] to harvest authentication credentials from unencrypted traffic, enabling initial access.

For initial access and execution, the adversary replicated malware through removable media [T1091] using an autorun.inf file to infect air-gapped systems, then utilized software deployment tools [T1072] like SCCM to deploy a malicious Group Policy Object that executed commands across the domain. To maintain persistence and evade detection, they modified power settings [T1653] to disable hibernation and ensure system availability while exploiting Outlook forms [T1137.003] to capture and exfiltrate email content automatically. Additionally, they substituted accessibility features [T1546.008] by replacing magnify.exe with a backdoor to gain SYSTEM-level access remotely.

In the credential access and lateral movement phase, the threat actor performed password spraying [T1110.003] against Telnet services to harvest valid credentials and used alternate authentication material [T1550] such as Pass-the-Hash to authenticate to domain controllers. For discovery, the payload queried system metadata [T1614] to pinpoint geographic locations and executed commands [T1049] like netstat -ano to map network connections on compromised hosts.

For collection and exfiltration, the malware activated video capture [T1125] via the victim's webcam to gather visual intelligence and employed internal proxies [T1090.001] to route communications between compromised assets, masking exfiltration activities. Throughout the campaign, logs showed routine system updates and false positives from legacy antivirus software, which were not indicative of malicious activity.

Mitigation recommendations include implementing network segmentation, monitoring for unusual DNS queries, and enforcing strict access controls on removable media. This scenario underscores the importance of comprehensive threat hunting and incident response training for blue teams.
