The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on a simulated APT campaign targeting critical infrastructure sectors, based on a fictional scenario for training. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance to identify network security appliances [T1590.006] and use nslookup commands to resolve target domains and identify associated CDN IP ranges [T1596.004], gathering intelligence on network defenses. On 2024-10-01, network administrators at a fictional energy company discovered a passive network tap connected to the main switch in the server room, indicating physical hardware additions [T1200]. System logs from the server showed unusual scheduled tasks created via PowerShell, with Kapeka malware persisting through scheduled tasks [T1053.005] while simultaneously executing reconnaissance scripts that used 'dir /s *.xml' to identify all XML files potentially containing Group Policy Preferences credentials [T1552.006]. The company's background includes operations across multiple states, with no prior incidents reported. Following initial access, the adversary employed dumped hashes to authenticate to other machines via pass the hash [T1550.002] and used steganography tool.exe to conceal command and control traffic within legitimate-looking images [T1001.002], evading detection. Data exfiltration involved employing OpenSSL to encrypt financial data prior to exfiltration over asymmetric encrypted non-C2 protocols [T1048.002], with compressed log files stored incrementally at https://c2.com/chunk with delays between each upload to manage data transfer size limits [T1030]. Post-exfiltration, the wiper malware wrote random data patterns across all sectors of the hard drive [T1561.001] and the virus injected fake blue screen of death images to panic users into paying ransoms as part of a defacement strategy [T1491]. Incident response teams noted increased network latency but attributed it to routine maintenance.
