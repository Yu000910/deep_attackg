On October 15, 2023, multiple financial institutions reported anomalous network activity, leading to the discovery of a coordinated attack campaign. The actors, identified as 'ShadowStrike', likely conduct reconnaissance through open-source intelligence gathering [T1589] and social engineering [T1586] to identify potential targets. Initial access was achieved by exploiting compromised VPN accounts [T1133], allowing unauthorized entry into the victim's corporate network. Once inside, the adversary executed a JavaScript-based credential harvester, dubbed 'WARPWIRE' [T1059.007], embedded in phishing emails to capture user credentials. Concurrently, a malicious Password Filter DLL was injected into the LSASS process memory [T1556.002] to intercept plaintext passwords during authentication attempts. For network reconnaissance, the actors used commands such as `netstat` [T1049] and `ipconfig` along with `nbtstat` and `tracert` [T1016] to map the environment and identify critical assets. Lateral movement was facilitated through Windows Remote Management (WinRM) [T1021.006], enabling the execution of remote commands on additional systems. To maintain persistence and exfiltrate data, the group leveraged web services like Discord [T1102] to download secondary payloads. Finally, as a disruptive measure, the attackers initiated a direct network flood [T1498.001] by sending continuous UDP packets to port 443, overwhelming HTTPS services and causing service degradation. System logs from affected entities showed increased failed login attempts and unusual outbound traffic patterns, though these were initially dismissed as routine anomalies. The campaign underscores the need for robust monitoring of external remote services and multi-factor authentication implementations.
