On March 15, 2024, SHADOWCRAWL initiated reconnaissance by using search engines [T1593.002] to identify vulnerable servers and researching victim infrastructure through compromised personal email accounts [T1586.002] to gather credentials and internal communications. The actors established a Dropbox Paper workspace [T1585.003] to collaboratively plan their operation, sharing target lists and attack strategies. Initial access was achieved via a drive-by compromise [T1189] on a legitimate industry news website, where malicious JavaScript redirected users to a payload delivery server. Upon compromise, execution involved using systemctl [T1569.003] to start a custom malicious service and employing Windows Management Instrumentation [T1047] via WMIC to run remote tasks and execute scripts. For persistence, the adversary modified a Docker image [T1525] to include a cron job for callback connections and wrote a VBScript file as a network logon script [T1037.003] through registry modifications. Defense evasion techniques included using Compiled HTML Files [T1218.001] to conceal payloads and deploying malware with a double file extension [T1036.007], such as 'report.pdf.exe', to trick users into execution. Discovery activities involved running a reconnaissance script that made Graph API queries for cloud service discovery [T1526] to identify all registered service principals and executing 'vim-cmd vmsvc/get.summary' for virtual machine discovery [T1673] to retrieve VM summaries. Additionally, the adversary used az ad user get-member-groups to enumerate cloud groups [T1069.003] assigned to the compromised identity. Command and control was maintained with fallback channels [T1008], where the malware switched to a backup channel to request new tokens after failed connections to the primary C2 server. System logs from the victim environment showed increased network traffic to unknown IPs, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to encrypted payloads. The targeted organization, a mid-sized fintech company, reported unusual login attempts from foreign IP addresses, though initial investigations attributed this to routine user activity.
