On October 26, 2023, a fictional financial services company, 'SecureFin Corp', reported anomalous activity on its internal network. Analysis revealed a coordinated attack campaign attributed to the fictional APT group 'CrimsonViper'. The company's security team noted unusual log entries in their SIEM, including failed authentication attempts from unknown IP addresses and unexpected service restarts, though these were initially dismissed as routine maintenance noise. SecureFin Corp, headquartered in New York with 500 employees, specializes in digital payment processing and maintains a hybrid cloud environment with on-premises Windows and Linux servers.

Initial Access: The campaign began with a phishing email [T1566] sent to an accounts payable employee, containing a malicious attachment disguised as an overdue invoice from a known vendor. The employee opened the attachment, which executed a macro that dropped a payload onto the workstation. Concurrently, during an internal audit, a rogue USB device was discovered plugged into a conference room computer; forensic analysis indicated it was used to simulate keyboard inputs [T1674] to bypass local security controls and execute commands, though no data exfiltration was confirmed from this vector.

Execution: On a compromised Linux server, the adversary employed systemctl [T1569.003] to start a malicious service named 'audit-helper', which executed custom scripts to establish a foothold. This service was configured to run at boot and communicated with a command-and-control (C2) server using encrypted sockets [T1205.001], avoiding standard protocols to evade detection.

Persistence: For long-term access, the actors installed a backdoor by modifying an existing CLR assembly in the database [T1505.001] to trigger on specific SQL events, such as user logins, and created a Windows service named 'javamtsup' [T1543.003] to maintain persistence across reboots. The malware configuration data was obfuscated using encryption [T1027.013] to hinder analysis, with Seasalt-like encoding observed in memory dumps.

Credential Access: The malware dumped LSA secrets [T1003.004] using Mimikatz-derived tools to extract cached domain credentials, which were then used for lateral movement. Additionally, the actors collected domain group information [T1069.002] by running commands like 'net group /domain' to enumerate administrative accounts and plan privilege escalation.

Discovery: To gather intelligence on the compromised environment, PowerShell scripts were used to extract service control manager logs [T1654] from the host, identifying running services and potential security controls. This data was exfiltrated to the C2 server alongside credential hashes.

Impact: In the final stage, the actors launched a network denial of service attack [T1498] against an internal testing server, simulating a DDoS to disrupt operations and test response capabilities, though no production systems were affected. This activity was logged in firewall logs as a spike in traffic from internal IPs, but it was initially attributed to a misconfigured load balancer during a routine security drill.
