    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training insights into a fictional APT campaign, 'ShadowGale'. This group has been observed targeting financial organizations in North America and Europe. Background checks indicate the actors operate from a region with high cybercriminal activity, though attribution remains unconfirmed. Initial analysis of network logs from a victim bank showed unusual outbound traffic on port 443, but this was later determined to be a false positive related to a scheduled backup. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance by accessing private data broker services to acquire sensitive corporate information about targets. They then purchased hosting servers with virtual currency and prepaid cards to support their infrastructure. The adversary wrote a credential dumping tool to extract password hashes from Windows domain controllers and injected hidden text containing popular search terms into the compromised website's footer to lure victims. A compromised script executed Mimikatz.exe to extract NTLM hashes from local system accounts while leveraging legitimate remote management tools to maintain persistent access. For execution, they exploited Adobe Flash vulnerability CVE-2015-8651 and used packers such as Themida to obfuscate malicious files. To establish persistence, they set LoadAppInit_DLLs in the Registry key SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows and employed COM hijacking. For defense evasion, PowerShell.exe was executed to disable Windows Defender real-time protection. Finally, they used legitimate utilities such as AnyDesk and PuTTy for maintaining remote access to victim environments. Incident responders noted that system performance degradation was initially attributed to a recent software update, but further investigation revealed malicious activity. The campaign's timeline suggests initial access occurred over a holiday weekend, exploiting reduced staffing levels.",
