The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on a fictional APT campaign for training purposes. ShadowMist, a simulated threat actor, has been observed targeting organizations with cloud-based services. The campaign begins with phishing emails masquerading as security alerts from legitimate cloud providers, such as Microsoft or Google, which direct users to a malicious website designed to harvest credentials [T1586.003]. Concurrently, the actors exploit ISP-level vulnerabilities to inject adware into HTTP responses, manipulating web traffic to serve malicious content [T1659]. Upon gaining initial access, the adversary executes a Lua script to terminate security processes and clear system event logs, aiming to evade detection [T1059.011]. To expand their foothold, automated tools are deployed to perform credential stuffing attacks against exposed Telnet ports, using previously breached credentials in a brute-force manner [T1110.001]. Finally, the malware establishes SSH tunnels to exfiltrate sensitive data through encrypted channels that mimic normal administrative connections, blending in with legitimate network traffic [T1071]. System logs from affected servers show unusual spikes in Telnet authentication attempts and SSH connections to external IPs, though these are not directly linked to the techniques. The targeted organization, a fictional mid-sized tech firm, reported no prior incidents, but internal monitoring flagged anomalous outbound traffic patterns.
