The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide a fictional, educational overview of the 'ShadowVeil' campaign, which has been observed targeting organizations in the energy and healthcare sectors since early 2024. This report is based on simulated incident response data and is designed for training purposes to help defenders identify and mitigate advanced threats.

Initial Access: The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by compromising a DNS server to redirect legitimate domain queries to attacker-controlled IP addresses [T1584], and they used Twitter polls as a covert signaling mechanism to activate dormant systems within the network [T1584.006]. Subsequently, they initiated phishing campaigns, sending emails with password-protected ZIP files containing trojanized executables to bypass email security filters [T1566], while also employing spearphishing voice calls where they impersonated IT support personnel to direct victims to download a malicious remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool for initial access [T1566.004].

Execution: Upon execution, the malware abused the vSphere Web Services SDK to run ESXi administration commands, establishing persistence on virtualized guest operating systems [T1675], and it exploited a vulnerability to gain SYSTEM privileges, directly modifying the LSASS process to alter authentication mechanisms [T1556]. The adversary then forged a golden ticket using the stolen KRBTGT password hash, setting it with a 10-year validity to maintain long-term access [T1558.001].

Persistence and Discovery: To gather additional intelligence, the actors used scripts to query SMB shares across the network, searching for administrative configuration files to identify sensitive data and system configurations [T1602], and they deployed a keylogging component to capture keystrokes from compromised systems, enabling credential theft [T1056.001].

Command and Control: For covert communication, the malware employed a dead drop resolver technique, hiding base64-encoded and encrypted command-and-control server locations within comments on legitimate websites to evade detection [T1102.001].

Exfiltration: The threat actor utilized RC4 encryption on harvested intellectual property before exfiltrating it via FTP over symmetric encrypted non-C2 protocols to bypass network monitoring [T1048.001], and they transferred the encrypted data to a cloud account using Google Cloud Storage services to move it to their own GCP project for further analysis [T1537].

Impact: In the final stage, the spyware modified a legitimate application executable to display a fake login screen at runtime, capturing user credentials through data manipulation [T1565.003]. System logs from affected organizations showed unusual network traffic spikes and failed authentication attempts, though these were not directly linked to the techniques used. The campaign resulted in simulated data breaches and operational disruptions, highlighting the need for robust endpoint detection and multi-factor authentication.

Recommendations: Organizations are advised to implement network segmentation, monitor for anomalous DNS queries and social engineering attempts, and conduct regular security awareness training. This fictional scenario underscores the importance of proactive threat hunting and incident response planning.
