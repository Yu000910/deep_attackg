APT-99, a suspected state-sponsored actor, has been observed conducting a sophisticated campaign against organizations using VMware vSphere environments. The group likely collected detailed network diagrams and infrastructure data from commercial threat intelligence providers [T1597] to plan their intrusion. Initial access was achieved by exploiting a compromised ISP channel to redirect user traffic through a malicious proxy, injecting malicious content into legitimate network streams [T1659], and using stolen VPN credentials to authenticate into the target network [T1078]. Upon gaining access, the actors employed Component Object Model (COM) objects [T1559.001] to execute queries and gather system information, such as host configurations and installed software. For persistence, they deployed a malicious vSphere Installation Bundle (VIB) [T1505.006] disguised as a legitimate VMware tool, which allowed them to maintain foothold on ESXi systems. To facilitate lateral movement and command-and-control (C2) communication, APT-99 used the built-in netsh `port proxy` command to create internal proxies on compromised systems [T1090.001], while encrypting C2 traffic with symmetric cryptography like RC4 [T1573.001] to evade detection. Additionally, they injected a malicious DLL into system processes [T1565] to manipulate configuration data and disable security controls, such as antivirus software and firewall rules. Throughout the campaign, APT-99 demonstrated a focus on stealth and long-term access, with activities logged in system event logs showing unusual network traffic patterns and failed authentication attempts from external IP addresses. The targeted organizations included energy and financial sectors, with no significant data exfiltration reported in this fictional scenario. Blue teams should monitor for anomalous proxy configurations, unexpected VIB installations, and COM object usage in virtual environments.
