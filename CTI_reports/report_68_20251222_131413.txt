Background: Crimson Veil is a suspected state-sponsored group with objectives focused on intellectual property theft and espionage. This report is based on a fictional incident at a mid-sized technology firm, 'TechNova Solutions', which reported anomalous network traffic and unauthorized access to its Azure environment in early 2024.

Attack Narrative: The actors initiated reconnaissance by scanning public code repositories like GitHub, where they discovered leaked corporate credentials from TechNova's development team [T1593.003]. Leveraging this information, they conducted spearphishing voice calls to employees, using social engineering tactics to gather additional access details while activating device microphones to capture ambient conversations for further intelligence [T1598.004]. To establish infrastructure, Crimson Veil acquired free-tier cloud accounts from providers like AWS and Azure, setting up phishing domains and command-and-control (C2) servers while avoiding financial costs [T1583]. They then exploited default accounts within TechNova's network, specifically targeting the Guest account that was left enabled with weak credentials, gaining initial foothold into the system [T1078.001]. Once inside, the actors used cloud administration commands, such as Azure RunCommand, to execute PowerShell scripts on virtual machines, enabling lateral movement and payload deployment [T1651]. To maintain persistence, they altered Group Policy settings to run a backdoor script from a remote server at system startup, embedding malicious code into network logon processes [T1037.003]. For evasion, the malicious script encoded its C2 payloads using a non-standard encoding scheme, replacing standard Base64 characters with special symbols to bypass detection [T1132.002]. Finally, they employed external proxies, utilizing a modified version of HTRAN to redirect connections between networks, facilitating data exfiltration and obscuring their origin [T1090.002].

Irrelevant Information: TechNova Solutions, founded in 2010, specializes in cloud-based analytics software and employs over 500 staff. During the incident, system logs showed routine backup processes at 02:00 UTC, unrelated to the attack. The company's internal investigation noted increased CPU usage on VM 'analytics-prod-01', but this was later attributed to a scheduled data processing job.
