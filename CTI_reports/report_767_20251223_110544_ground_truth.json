    "clean_text": "SilentViper likely conducts initial reconnaissance through social engineering to gather domain account credentials, which are then used for unauthorized access. Upon gaining access, the actor leverages AppleScript to inject malicious JavaScript into web browsers, while simultaneously modifying browser shortcuts to launch malicious extensions that are named to match legitimate resources. To establish persistence, SilentViper modifies the Windows Registry by adding a Class ID in the current user hive. For execution, the actor injects shellcode into legitimate processes using Asynchronous Procedure Calls, encoding command and control traffic with Base64 and utilizing dynamic DNS services for resilient communication. During the investigation, system logs from the compromised network showed routine backup processes running, but no anomalies were detected in user login patterns prior to the incident. The targeted organization, a mid-sized bank, reported no financial losses, but experienced temporary disruption to online services.",
