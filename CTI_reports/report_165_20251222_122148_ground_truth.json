    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the fictional APT group Crimson Viper. This report is based on a simulated incident for training purposes and does not reflect real-world events. Crimson Viper likely initiated reconnaissance by scanning databases such as Shodan for exposed remote desktop protocol (RDP) services, while simultaneously probing network trust dependencies through phishing emails to IT staff requesting VPN configurations and domain relationships. The actors then employed spearphishing attachments to drop malicious .ps1 scripts for credential collection and used spearphishing links to distribute NETWIRE via email campaigns, often masquerading as legitimate files like decoy .jpg extensions containing malicious Visual Basic scripts. Upon initial access, the adversary leveraged the Component Object Model via ShellWindows objects to execute PowerShell commands locally, which facilitated the addition of cron jobs in /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root for scheduled data exfiltration at 2 AM daily. System logs from the compromised Linux server showed unusual SSH activity, including hijacked SSH agent sockets used to authenticate to multiple DMZ systems, while on Windows environments, the attacker utilized Add-MailboxPermission.ps1 to grant additional email delegate permissions to executive accounts. For data exfiltration, the group employed the application layer protocol such as SMB to disguise malicious transfers as normal file server activity, and they conducted data manipulation by modifying inventory management software to falsify stock levels, potentially causing operational disruptions. Background information indicates the targeted organization is a mid-sized manufacturing company with outdated patch management processes, though this detail is not directly related to the attack techniques.",
