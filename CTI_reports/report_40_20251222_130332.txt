On October 15, 2023, a mid-sized bank, 'SecureTrust Financial', reported anomalous network activity after an employee received a suspicious email. The bank's SOC team initiated an investigation, revealing a multi-stage attack. Background: SecureTrust Financial, established in 1998, operates across five states with 500 employees and uses a hybrid cloud infrastructure. Initial logs showed increased outbound traffic on port 4444, but no immediate alerts were triggered by their legacy antivirus. The attack began with the adversary sending a spearphishing email [T1566.001] that appeared to originate from a trusted vendor, containing an attachment named 'Invoice_Report.DOC.exe' which used a double file extension to disguise itself as a document [T1036.007]. Upon execution, the malware leveraged the ShellBrowserWindow COM object to load and run a malicious payload in memory [T1559.001], bypassing traditional file-based detection. Once established, the actor conducted discovery activities, using commands like 'net use' to enumerate network shares and connections [T1049] while simultaneously checking for the presence of Kaspersky antivirus software to assess security defenses [T1518.001]. The malware then implemented a web portal capture mechanism, redirecting login attempts to a controlled site to harvest credentials as users updated their passwords [T1056.003]. Collected data, including browser cookies and network configurations, was staged in a temporary directory using bash scripts [T1074] before being encrypted with AES-256 using a hardcoded key for archiving [T1560.003]. For exfiltration, the actor embedded the encrypted data into benign-looking XML files using steganography to avoid detection [T1001.002] and transmitted it over non-standard ports such as 4444 and 7900 to establish command and control channels [T1571]. Incident response teams noted that system performance logs showed a 15% CPU spike during peak activity, but no further unauthorized access was detected after containment measures were applied.
