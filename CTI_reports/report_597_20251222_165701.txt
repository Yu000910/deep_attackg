In this fictional scenario, 'ShadowHarvest' actors likely conduct reconnaissance by deploying a web form on a compromised site to collect login credentials from visitors [T1589.001] while simultaneously querying Facebook profiles of executives to gather information about physical office locations [T1591.001]. The actors then leveraged compromised identities to access the target network via SSH and VPNs [T1133], using inter-process communication via pipes to coordinate malicious activities [T1559]. Once inside, they installed a malicious ISAPI filter DLL on the web server to ensure persistent access [T1505] and escalated privileges by running sudo -u root without a password [T1548.003]. To exfiltrate data, the malware dumped securityd's memory space to recover unencrypted Safari autofill data [T1555.002] and leveraged MailSniper to search for calendar invitations containing meeting locations and participants [T1114.002]. Network reconnaissance involved using libpcap to sniff traffic and identify open ports for command channels [T1205.001], culminating in the execution of a fork bomb script that continuously spawned new processes to exhaust system resources [T1499.004]. System logs from the target environment showed routine authentication failures unrelated to the attack, and the company, a mid-sized regional bank, had recently upgraded its firewall firmware with no reported issues.
