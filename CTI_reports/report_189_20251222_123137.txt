CrimsonVortex likely conducted initial reconnaissance by exploiting a trusted relationship with a third-party contractor [T1199] to gain access to the victim's network, where they remotely executed systeminfo.exe to collect UEFI firmware version details [T1592.003] and other system information [T1082] for targeting purposes. The adversary then developed custom capabilities, including a credential dumping tool to extract password hashes from Windows domain controllers [T1587], and leveraged the hypervisor CLI by running 'esxcli system snmp set --enable true' to enable SNMP for additional reconnaissance [T1059.012]. User execution was achieved through a compromised website delivering a malicious PDF that drops and executes njRAT when viewed in the browser [T1204], after which the attacker abused mavinject.exe to inject a malicious DLL into a legitimate process [T1218.013]. To maintain persistence and lateral movement, CrimsonVortex executed RDP hijacking using tscon.exe to disconnect legitimate users and hijack their remote desktop sessions [T1563.002] while configuring PiKVM to establish redundant remote control over critical infrastructure systems [T1219.003]. For data exfiltration, the group employed techniques to break large files of interest into smaller chunks to bypass size limits [T1030]. In the final stages, the adversary deployed a Monero cryptocurrency mining tool to hijack compute resources [T1496.001] and exploited the user registration feature by automating thousands of sign-up attempts that overwhelmed the database in an application exhaustion flood [T1499.003]. Logs from the victim's SIEM showed routine network traffic spikes unrelated to the attack, and background checks revealed the company had recently upgraded its firewall firmware without incident.
