Background: ShadowPhish is a fictional APT group believed to operate with state-sponsored objectives, focusing on energy and telecommunications sectors. Initial analysis suggests the group conducts extensive reconnaissance, including monitoring public vulnerability databases for recently disclosed software flaws [T1588.006]. In a recent incident at a fictional company, 'InfraSecure Inc.', network logs showed unusual traffic patterns from compromised Ubiquiti devices, which were later identified as collection points for credentials harvested via phishing campaigns [T1584.008]. The actors deployed a malicious script, phishing.ps1, that captured email authentication details from unsuspecting users through deceptive login pages [T1586.002]. Once initial access was achieved, the adversary used valid administrator credentials, likely obtained from previous breaches, to move laterally into restricted network segments [T1078]. On macOS systems within the environment, malware wrote an AppleScript payload to the Documents folder, which was designed to download and execute additional malware [T1059.002]. To maintain persistence, the malware installed a malicious service disguised as 'Windows Audio Enhancement' using systemd timers [T1053.006]. During the execution phase, the script leveraged cloud secrets management stores by executing commands like 'aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id ssl-certificates' to steal TLS private keys [T1555.006]. For data collection, MoustachedBouncer plugins were used to save captured screenshots to a remote SMB share at `.\AActdata\` [T1074.002], and Empire tools were employed to ZIP directories on the target system for archiving collected data [T1560]. Finally, the remote access tool established command and control (C2) communications using RSA encryption to avoid signature detection [T1573]. Additional logs from InfraSecure's SIEM indicated routine system updates and user login attempts, which were unrelated to the attack but provided context for the investigation.
