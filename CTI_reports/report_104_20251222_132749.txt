On 2023-10-15, CRIMSON TIDE actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify high-value targets in the financial sector, leveraging open-source intelligence (OSINT) to gather employee details and network architecture. The campaign began with Initial Access, where adversaries used removable media [T1091] to exploit Windows AUTORUN features, similar to Conficker variants, by distributing infected USB drives at a corporate conference, leading to the execution of malicious scripts. During Execution, the actors employed AppleScript [T1059.002] to enumerate running processes and system information on macOS endpoints, while simultaneously using installer packages [T1546.016] to disable security controls and establish persistence through postinstall scripts. In the Persistence phase, the group created snapshots [T1578.001] via the CreateInstance API to instantiate new cloud compute resources, enabling lateral movement and data staging. For Defense Evasion, they executed JamPlus [T1127.003] to download additional payloads from remote servers while modifying TLS handshake headers to implement domain fronting [T1090.004], hiding actual destination servers. During Discovery, the actors performed system owner/user discovery [T1033] to collect usernames from victim machines and searched network shared drives [T1039] using commands like 'dir \\fileserver\shared\*.docx /s' to locate sensitive documents. In the Impact phase, CRIMSON TIDE conducted service exhaustion floods [T1499.002] by exploiting SSL/TLS renegotiation to repeatedly initiate handshakes, consuming server resources and causing service degradation. Throughout the campaign, system logs from infected endpoints showed anomalous network traffic spikes, and background checks revealed the targeted organization had recently migrated to hybrid cloud infrastructure, though these details are not directly tagged as techniques.
