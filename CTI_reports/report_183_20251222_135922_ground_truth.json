    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign. Crimson Serpent actors likely conduct reconnaissance by using automated scripts to search WHOIS records for technical contact information of victim domains. Upon initial access, the malware executed an nmap scan to map the internal network topology of the compromised system, while simultaneously injecting malicious code into a PowerShell script named evil.ps1 to steal credentials from memory. The adversary then employed PowerShell to download additional payloads from command-and-control servers, exploiting path interception opportunities in the PATH environment variable for privilege escalation. Throughout the campaign, Remsec malware was used to communicate via ICMP, TCP, and UDP protocols, evading traditional network monitoring. System logs from the victim's environment show routine updates to Active Directory, but no anomalies were detected in user login patterns during this period. The organization, a mid-sized financial services firm, reported no operational disruptions, though internal audits flagged unusual outbound traffic to unknown IP addresses in the Asia-Pacific region, which were later attributed to this simulated activity.",

The activity involves initial access via malicious dependencies, internal network mapping, and command-and-control using non-standard protocols, designed for blue team training to enhance detection and response capabilities.",
