    "clean_text": "On 2023-10-15, analysts at a mid-sized bank, 'SecureBank Inc.', detected anomalous login attempts from external IP addresses. SecureBank, founded in 1995, operates primarily in the Northeast U.S. with 500 employees and uses a hybrid cloud infrastructure. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by hosting a fake authentication form on a compromised website to capture user credentials and sent phishing messages impersonating IT support to collect remote access VPN credentials from employees, compromising accounts. Subsequently, malware exploited a compromised ISP channel to redirect user traffic through a malicious proxy, injecting content. System logs from 2023-10-16 show failed login attempts from IP 192.168.1.100, which was later identified as part of the attack. The threat actor used the built-in Guest account to establish a foothold on the compromised system and employed wmic.exe for local discovery information via Windows Management Instrumentation. They manipulated HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\OSConfig\\Security Packages to load a custom security package that exfiltrates authentication data and wrote an AppleScript that uses System Events to add itself to startup items. A script located and exfiltrated the LastPass vault file from the browser's application data directory. During lateral movement, the actors used compromised Azure credentials for credential theft activity and moved to on-premises systems via cloud services. They leveraged SSH to exfiltrate data through encrypted tunnels that appeared as normal administrative traffic and used a copy of tor2web proxy for HTTPS communications as a multi-hop proxy. Modules automatically uploaded gathered documents to the C2 server for automated exfiltration. Additionally, attackers used NTP protocol exploitation with spoofed source IPs to generate traffic amplification against the target. Network traffic analysis revealed spikes in outbound data to unknown domains, unrelated to the attack, such as routine backup processes to AWS S3 buckets.",

The campaign involves credential harvesting, account compromise, traffic manipulation, and automated exfiltration techniques. Blue teams are advised to review logs for suspicious authentication attempts, monitor for unusual proxy configurations, and enforce multi-factor authentication.",
