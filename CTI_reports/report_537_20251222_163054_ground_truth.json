    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training insights into sophisticated attack methodologies. In this fictional scenario, ShadowGale actors initiated their campaign by compromising a third-party web server to host malicious payloads and simultaneously deployed a compromised Teensy USB device programmed to execute PowerShell commands upon insertion into target systems. Initial access was further achieved through a spear-phishing voice campaign, where phone calls directed users to download and run a remote access trojan disguised as a document viewer. Once inside, the actors leveraged cmd.exe to execute scripts and commands for lateral movement and data exfiltration while using /sbin/emond to activate custom rules that provided elevated privileges and persistent access. For persistence, they abused JamPlus.exe to compile and execute malicious.jam scripts and employed network sniffing via AWS Traffic Mirroring to harvest unencrypted credentials from target EC2 instances. Discovery activities included calling GetUserDefaultUILanguage to infer the geographical region of compromised systems and executing the Azure Storage Blobs ListBlobs function to enumerate blobs within specific containers. Evasion tactics involved using 'sleep.exe 120' to delay malicious activity and bypass automated analysis systems, and command and control was obfuscated by leveraging XMPP's federated architecture to blend traffic with legitimate instant messaging communications. Finally, to inhibit recovery, the actors resized and deleted volume shadow copy files to prevent system restoration after encryption. Logs from affected systems show routine network traffic spikes unrelated to the attack, and company background checks reveal no prior incidents at the targeted financial institution, which operates primarily in North America with cloud-based services hosted on AWS and Azure platforms.",
