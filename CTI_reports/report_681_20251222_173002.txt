The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional, high-fidelity attack scenario. In this simulated campaign, the APT group 'ShadowVeil' has been observed targeting financial and technology sectors with containerized environments. Actors likely conduct reconnaissance by gathering victim identity information [T1589] and using tools to search CDNs like jsdelivr.com for publicly accessible customer assets [T1596.004]. Initial access was achieved through exploiting a public-facing application vulnerability in a Windows container, leading to execution of Siloscape malware [T1190], and via spearphishing links in emails that directed victims to malicious MSC files based on User Agent fingerprinting [T1566.002]. Once inside, the adversary employed schtasks.exe to create scheduled tasks for lateral movement [T1053.005] while using sdbinst.exe to apply a custom Shim database that bypasses security controls [T1546.011]. For evasion, they leveraged the TxF API to write malicious payloads into the svchost.exe memory space through Process Doppelgänging [T1055.013] and abused DHCP INFORM messages to spoof network configurations and gather details from clients [T1557.003]. To facilitate persistence and access, Mimikatz's CRYPTO module was used to steal and forge authentication certificates [T1649], and C2 communications were secured using symmetric cryptography with XOR and AES encryption [T1573.001]. System logs from affected hosts show increased network traffic and failed login attempts, though these are unrelated to the core techniques. Background: The targeted organizations had recently migrated to hybrid cloud setups, but this did not directly influence the attack vector.
