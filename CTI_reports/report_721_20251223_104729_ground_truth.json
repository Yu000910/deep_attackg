    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the fictional APT group 'ShadowGale'. This campaign targets financial organizations, exploiting vulnerabilities in external services and cloud infrastructure. Initial reconnaissance involved scanning for outdated network devices, with actors acquiring initial access by purchasing compromised credentials from dark web marketplaces and exploiting weak authentication on corporate VPN services to establish a foothold. During execution, the malware utilized the Component Object Model (COM) interface to execute unauthorized commands while simultaneously downloading payloads via SEO poisoning, where threat actors modified website HTML with hidden div elements. For persistence, actors abused system-assigned managed identities in cloud accounts to maintain long-term access and modified an existing kernel module to embed backdoor functionality. Defense evasion included deploying VirtualBox binaries to run a hidden virtual instance for data staging and using non-standard encoding with a custom base64 alphabet for command and control (C2) communications over compromised Cyberoam VPN appliances. Discovery activities involved using the `net time` command to assess system synchronization as part of advanced reconnaissance. Credential access was achieved through browser session hijacking via DLL sideloading into memory and stealing web session cookies to bypass multi-factor authentication on cloud resources. Collection efforts focused on extracting financial records from unsecured Amazon S3 buckets, while impact included resource hijacking with a hidden cryptocurrency miner consuming significant CPU cycles. Logs from affected systems showed anomalous network traffic patterns, but no direct correlation to production outages was observed in this simulated scenario.",
