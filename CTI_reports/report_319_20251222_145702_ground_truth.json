    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign, 'ShadowGale', which targets financial organizations like GlobalTrust Bank, a mid-sized institution with assets of $50 billion and operations across North America and Europe. In this scenario, actors likely conduct reconnaissance by querying paid threat intelligence feeds and purchasing system architecture documentation from dark web marketplaces to gather details about the target's security tools and technical environment. Additionally, they used Google search operators, such as 'site:targetcompany.com filetype:pdf', to locate internal documents like network diagrams and employee handbooks, which were found in unsecured SharePoint repositories during a routine audit log review (e.g., event ID 4688 showed anomalous access patterns). The actors then compromised a DNS server in a third-party data center, configuring it to serve malicious responses for specific domain queries, while simultaneously sending spear-phishing emails mimicking cloud service providers to collect authentication details from IT staff, as evidenced by a spike in failed login attempts (e.g., 10 attempts in 5 minutes from IP 192.168.1.100). For data exfiltration, adversaries set up a shared Dropbox folder accessible only through burner accounts and abused WebVPN traffic to targeted devices to achieve unauthorized remote code execution, followed by configuring schtasks.exe to run a backdoor payload daily at 3 AM. In cloud environments, the adversary leveraged the Azure Serial Console to troubleshoot and manipulate a virtual machine's operating system directly, while the malware used DHCP protocol to redirect client traffic through an attacker-controlled proxy. Data collection involved ROKRAT-like capabilities to gather host data and specific file types, with C2 communications using HTTP GET and POST requests, and a PowerShell script ran 'Set-LocalUser -Name 'serviceaccount' -PasswordNeverExpires $false' to disrupt automated services, causing service outages reported in internal tickets (e.g., ticket #INC-2024-789).",

The campaign employs sophisticated reconnaissance, infrastructure compromise, and cloud exploitation techniques, as observed in a fictional incident at 'GlobalTrust Bank' from January to March 2024. Blue teams are advised to review detection strategies and mitigation measures outlined in this report.",
