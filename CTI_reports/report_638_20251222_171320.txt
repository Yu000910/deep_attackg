Earth Lusca, a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, initiated Operation Wocao by conducting vulnerability scanning [T1595.002] on public-facing servers to identify weaknesses, while simultaneously establishing fake LinkedIn profiles [T1585] to enhance credibility for social engineering. The actors then employed spearphishing attachments [T1598.002] to drop malicious.ps1 into the Temp directory, which used PowerShell to gather credential data from Windows Credential Manager [T1555.004] and inhibit system recovery [T1490] by deleting backup files via vssadmin. Concurrently, they compromised the supply chain [T1195] by modifying legitimate development_tools.exe to include a backdoor before distribution, and utilized SEO poisoning [T1608.006] by embedding hidden div elements with popular product names into a compromised website to lure victims. For infrastructure, Earth Lusca purchased servers with Bitcoin [T1583.004] to host command-and-control (C2) operations, where they leveraged valid accounts [T1078] to maintain persistent access to victim networks and executed arbitrary commands on compromised ESXi guest VMs using the vSphere Web Services SDK [T1675]. In containerized environments, the attacker updated ClusterRoleBinding.yaml to grant cluster-wide permissions [T1098.006] to a rogue service account, while loading a kernel extension via kextload [T1547.006] to re-establish connections after reboot. Communication was facilitated through non-application layer protocols [T1095] such as TCP and UDP for stealthy data exfiltration.
