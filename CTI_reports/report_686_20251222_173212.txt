CrimsonTide, a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, initiated its campaign by exploiting a known vulnerability, CVE-2023-3519, in a Citrix NetScaler application [T1190], which served as the primary entry point into the victim's network. Following initial access, the actors executed 'docker create' to deploy a malicious container image designed to bypass host-based security controls and establish a persistent foothold [T1610]. Within the container, they leveraged Component Object Model (COM) to instantiate a malicious script object, enabling inter-process communication to run arbitrary code locally and evade traditional process monitoring [T1559]. Concurrently, the compromised environment included irrelevant system logs showing routine backup processes and network traffic from non-malicious sources, such as automated software updates and employee VPN connections, which were not indicative of malicious activity. To facilitate lateral movement, CrimsonTide used a compromised administrator account to modify Okta conditional access settings, disabling location-based restrictions and allowing unauthorized access from external IP addresses [T1556.009]. The actors then employed tools like CDumper and EDumper to extract credentials from Chrome and Edge browsers [T1555.003], while using the 'net time' command to gather system time and time zone information for timing their operations [T1124]. As part of reconnaissance, they conducted software discovery to identify installed programs on compromised hosts [T1518] and enumerated Windows logs using 'wevtutil.exe' and PowerShell commands like 'Get-EventLog security' to search for successful logons and audit trails [T1654]. CrimsonTide also replicated through removable media by infecting USB drives to spread across air-gapped networks [T1091] and automated the collection of harvested credential data by downloading a module that built detailed reports [T1119]. For command and control (C2), they established bidirectional communication by retrieving instructions from a Google Doc [T1102.002] and exfiltrated sensitive documents over web services using a malicious PowerShell script [T1567]. Throughout the campaign, additional noise was present, including benign network scans from internal IT teams and false-positive alerts from legacy antivirus software, which did not correlate with the malicious activities described.
