    "clean_text": "SilentShade likely conducted reconnaissance by querying DNS to resolve assets.example.com, analyzing CDN usage to map infrastructure. The actors then created a counterfeit Instagram profile impersonating a bank's official account, gathering customer data through spearphishing services. In subsequent phases, they sent targeted emails with links to actor-controlled Google Drive documents, leveraging spearphishing links to deliver initial payloads. Upon compromise, the malware used stolen domain admin accounts to move laterally within the victim domain, accessing sensitive systems. The adversary employed a compromised developer account to write a Dockerfile with embedded credential harvesting scripts, deploying malicious images to cloud environments. For execution, the malware utilized thread execution hijacking within legitimate system processes to run payloads covertly, while bypassing security controls by writing disguised executables to user documents with quarantine metadata removed. System logs from 2023-10-15 show unusual PowerShell activity, but this was unrelated. The actors further leveraged digitally signed Microsoft binaries to load malicious DLLs through system script proxy execution, and exploited libpcap libraries to capture network packets, identifying covert communication channels via traffic signaling. To obfuscate command and control traffic, the malware employed base64 encoding before data transmission, effectively hiding communications. Internal investigation noted increased failed login attempts on domain controllers, though these were attributed to misconfigured scripts.",

The campaign involved reconnaissance via CDNs, spearphishing, lateral movement using stolen domain accounts, and advanced evasion techniques including malicious images and traffic signaling. Blue teams should review logs for DNS queries to assets.example.com and monitor for unauthorized Dockerfile modifications.",
