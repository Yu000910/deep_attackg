On 2024-09-15, security analysts at a fictional financial firm, 'SecureBank Inc.', detected anomalous activity following a series of targeted attacks. The campaign, attributed to the fictional APT group 'SilentAnchor', began with reconnaissance where the actor queried a paid threat intelligence feed to gather employee email addresses [T1597.001]. Subsequently, the attacker initiated a spearphishing voice call posing as IT support, tricking a user into revealing their system credentials [T1566.004]. Upon gaining access, the adversary used PowerShell to deploy a malicious container via 'docker start', which operated network reconnaissance tools while blending in with legitimate Docker activity [T1610]. To maintain persistence, the threat actors dumped credentials from Credential Manager using Mimikatz and modified user account permissions [T1098]. Discovery activities included using tools like LunarWeb to capture group policy settings [T1615] while conducting scanning for exposed TCP port 7001, SSH, and Redis servers [T1046]. In cloud environments, ROADTools was employed to enumerate Azure AD applications and service principals [T1526], and a SharePoint enumeration tool, spwebmember, was used to dump sensitive data from SharePoint repositories [T1213.002]. For command and control, the malware utilized a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) with a user-specific key that changes daily to hide C2 addresses [T1568.002]. Data exfiltration involved breaking sensitive files into fragments using custom_exfil_script.ps1 to avoid network monitoring alerts [T1030]. Finally, as part of disruption, ransomware employed 'sc config Themes start= disabled' to stop the desktop themes service from starting automatically [T1489]. Logs from SecureBank's SIEM showed increased network traffic on port 443, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to the stealthy nature of the container deployment. The company's background includes a recent migration to hybrid cloud infrastructure, which may have expanded the attack surface. Analysis of firewall logs indicated normal Docker API calls during business hours, masking the malicious activity.
