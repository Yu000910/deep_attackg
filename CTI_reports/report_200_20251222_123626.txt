On 2023-10-15, analysts at a mid-sized bank, 'SecureBank Inc.', detected anomalous login attempts from external IP addresses. SecureBank, founded in 1995, operates primarily in the Northeast U.S. with 500 employees and uses a hybrid cloud infrastructure. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by hosting a fake authentication form on a compromised website to capture user credentials [T1589.001] and sent phishing messages impersonating IT support to collect remote access VPN credentials from employees, compromising accounts [T1586]. Subsequently, malware exploited a compromised ISP channel to redirect user traffic through a malicious proxy, injecting content [T1659]. System logs from 2023-10-16 show failed login attempts from IP 192.168.1.100, which was later identified as part of the attack. The threat actor used the built-in Guest account to establish a foothold on the compromised system [T1078.001] and employed wmic.exe for local discovery information via Windows Management Instrumentation [T1047]. They manipulated HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig\Security Packages to load a custom security package that exfiltrates authentication data [T1547.005] and wrote an AppleScript that uses System Events to add itself to startup items [T1547.015]. A script located and exfiltrated the LastPass vault file from the browser's application data directory [T1555.005]. During lateral movement, the actors used compromised Azure credentials for credential theft activity and moved to on-premises systems via cloud services [T1021.007]. They leveraged SSH to exfiltrate data through encrypted tunnels that appeared as normal administrative traffic [T1071] and used a copy of tor2web proxy for HTTPS communications as a multi-hop proxy [T1090.003]. Modules automatically uploaded gathered documents to the C2 server for automated exfiltration [T1020]. Additionally, attackers used NTP protocol exploitation with spoofed source IPs to generate traffic amplification against the target [T1498.002]. Network traffic analysis revealed spikes in outbound data to unknown domains, unrelated to the attack, such as routine backup processes to AWS S3 buckets.
