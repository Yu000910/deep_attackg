On June 15, 2024, network administrators at a fictional energy company, 'PowerGrid Inc.', discovered a passive tap [T1200] attached to the Ethernet line in the server room during a routine inspection. This hardware addition was likely installed by an intruder posing as a maintenance technician two weeks prior. Following this physical breach, the adversary leveraged cloud administration tools to execute malicious commands via Azure RunCommand [T1651], which deleted system log files and obfuscated forensic evidence. To establish persistent access, the actors replaced magnify.exe with a custom backdoor [T1546.008], enabling remote SYSTEM-level privileges on compromised endpoints. Concurrently, the threat actor deployed a Wi-Fi Pineapple to create an evil twin access point [T1557.004], performing SSL stripping on HTTPS connections to intercept unencrypted credentials from employees connecting to the corporate network. For lateral movement, the group utilized the SMB protocol [T1071] to mimic standard file-sharing operations and propagate across systems, while simultaneously deploying a Monero cryptocurrency mining tool [T1496.001] to hijack computational resources for financial gain. System logs from affected servers showed unusual spikes in CPU usage, averaging 95% over several days, though initial alerts were dismissed as routine maintenance activities. PowerGrid Inc., established in 1995, operates multiple substations across the region, with no prior significant security incidents reported.
