    "clean_text": "On 2023-10-15, a fictional energy sector company, 'NexusGrid Inc.', reported anomalous network activity following a routine software update. Initial logs from their SIEM showed unexpected Lambda function executions in AWS, correlating with increased CPU usage on Windows servers. Background: NexusGrid uses a hybrid cloud environment with CI/CD pipelines managed via Jenkins for deploying operational technology (OT) control systems. The attack began with a supply chain compromise, where adversaries infiltrated the Jenkins pipeline to inject malicious code into production artifacts, leveraging this to trigger arbitrary serverless execution by crafting event data that activated a Lambda function designed to deploy ransomware payloads. Subsequently, the ransomware abused system services through svchost.exe to load an encrypted malicious DLL, which facilitated data encryption across multiple endpoints. For persistence, the malware employed application shimming by creating a shim database to patch services.exe, ensuring it remained active after reboots, while simultaneously collecting credential material via Ccache files from user temporary directories, such as krb5cc_1000, to enable lateral movement. Additionally, the threat actors established covert communication through content injection by embedding backdoor payloads into DNS queries, allowing persistent access without triggering traditional firewall alerts, and used port knocking techniques, sniffing network traffic with libpcap libraries to identify and exploit open ports for command-and-control (C2) channels. Incident response teams noted that the attack was detected during a routine audit of Lambda function logs, which showed anomalous execution patterns not aligned with scheduled tasks.",

This advisory is intended for blue team training purposes, illustrating a multi-vector attack that exploits supply chain vulnerabilities, serverless execution, and persistence mechanisms to compromise critical infrastructure environments. The scenario is based on fictional intelligence and does not reflect real-world events.",
