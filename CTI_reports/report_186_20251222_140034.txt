The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide insights into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group 'SteelShadow' in a simulated attack scenario against a financial services company, FinSecure Corp. FinSecure Corp, a mid-sized firm specializing in investment management, reported anomalous network activity on June 15, 2024, with initial logs showing increased DNS queries from internal systems. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by performing DNS queries against multiple nameservers to enumerate subdomains of the corporate domain [T1596.001] and queried Crunchbase for funding rounds and investor details of the victim company [T1593]. Subsequently, the adversary distributed OutSteel through malicious links contained within spearphishing emails [T1566.002] that mimicked legitimate government-related domains to deliver malicious webpages containing links to documents or other content for user execution [T1204.001]. Upon execution, the malware employed PowerShell to actively download malicious payloads while simultaneously modifying registry keys for persistence, as observed in system logs from the compromised workstation WS-102. If Shamoon cannot access shares using current privileges, it attempts access using hard-coded, domain-specific credentials gathered earlier in the intrusion [T1078.002]. For lateral movement, the attacker configured a CronJob to execute a container designed for lateral movement every 6 hours [T1053.007] and used at.exe to run a data exfiltration tool at midnight [T1053.002]. The backdoor employed SMTP with TLS encryption to covertly transmit stolen credentials to an attacker-controlled server [T1071.003], and the threat actor employed ROMMONkit to automatically duplicate and exfiltrate network traffic containing financial data [T1020.001]. Additional irrelevant logs show routine backup processes and user login attempts from legitimate IP ranges, which are not indicative of malicious activity.
