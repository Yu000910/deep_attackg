The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams about the fictional threat actor ShadowCobra, which has been observed targeting financial organizations in a simulated training scenario. ShadowCobra likely conducted reconnaissance by querying a paid threat intelligence feed to gather details about the target's security tools [T1597.001] and employed nmap's host discovery techniques to identify the victim's public IP blocks [T1590.005]. The actor then acquired a banking trojan through a criminal forum transaction [T1588.001] and exploited malware.exe's fileless execution capability to avoid antivirus scans [T1584.005]. In a supply chain compromise, malicious code was injected into a popular open-source library used by thousands of applications [T1195]. Upon initial access, the malware used Windows Management Instrumentation to gather system information [T1047] while simultaneously scanning for open ports on the compromised machine [T1046]. For persistence, it installed a malicious Visual Studio Code extension that runs on startup [T1219.001]. In the final stages, the malware executed a fork bomb script that continuously spawned new processes until system resources were exhausted [T1499.004] and exploited a botnet to overwhelm the network with SYN flood packets [T1498]. System logs from the target's firewall showed unusual traffic spikes at 03:00 UTC, and background checks revealed the organization had recently updated its open-source dependencies, though these details are not directly linked to the tagged techniques. Blue teams should monitor for anomalous WMI queries, unexpected IDE extensions, and network service discovery attempts to mitigate similar attacks.
