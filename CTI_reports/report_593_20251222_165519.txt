The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign designated 'ShadowHarvest'. This campaign targets organizations in the energy and manufacturing sectors, with observed activity beginning in early 2024. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify vulnerabilities in web applications, though no specific logs confirm this phase. Initial access was achieved through a spear-phishing email containing a malicious attachment, which executed a tailored exploit 'custom_exploit.exe' [T1587.004] to bypass endpoint detection and achieve code execution on the victim's Windows 10 system, as recorded in event ID 4688 on the host DESKTOP-7A3B2C. Following execution, the malware, identified as a variant of njRAT, was configured to replicate through removable media [T1091] by copying itself to USB drives and modifying autorun.inf files, with system logs showing multiple drive insertions in the past 24 hours. The adversary then employed inter-process communication [T1559] via Component Object Model to instantiate a malicious object and run arbitrary PowerShell scripts, while simultaneously attempting to acquire valid domain account credentials [T1078.002] through brute-force attacks against Active Directory, as evidenced by failed login attempts in the security log. To maintain persistent access, the threat actor leveraged an existing OAuth application [T1671] to integrate with the victim's cloud email account, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive communications, with anomalous sign-ins detected from IP 203.0.113.45. For lateral movement, the actor used tools like plainpwd, a modified version of Mimikatz, to dump Windows credentials from LSASS memory [T1003.001], and conducted discovery by retrieving browser history and database files [T1217] from Chrome and Firefox, collecting the username [T1033] from the victim's machine, and gathering network adapter information [T1016] using Win32 API calls. The malware then initiated a remote VNC session [T1021.005] by downloading a plugin to enable real-time control, captured video [T1125] from the webcam for surveillance, and enumerated data from internal code repositories [T1213.003] such as GitHub to steal proprietary source code. Command and control was established through fast-flux DNS [T1568.001] by registering a DNS A record pointing to a dynamic network of IP addresses, and persistence was enhanced via port knocking [T1205.001] by creating raw sockets to send custom protocol packets, ensuring stealthy communication with C2 servers. Additional noise includes background on the victim organization, 'GlobalEnergy Corp.', a mid-sized utility company with operations in North America, and unrelated system alerts for low disk space on server SRV-02.
