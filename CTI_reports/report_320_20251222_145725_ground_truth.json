    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign designated 'ShadowMimic'. This campaign targets organizations in the technology and finance sectors, with initial activities traced back to mid-2023. Actors likely conduct reconnaissance to identify cloud storage accounts and software distribution points. In the initial access phase, the adversary compromised a GitHub repository to host malicious payloads, including encrypted command and control modules, while simultaneously obtaining cloud storage service accounts to exfiltrate stolen data. System logs from affected entities show unusual API calls to Azure services, though these were initially dismissed as false positives. Execution involved replacing a legitimate compiled binary on a software distribution server with a trojanized version that contained additional backdoor functionality, leading to widespread deployment across victim networks. The actors then employed PowerShell commands via Azure Runbooks to remotely execute scripts and establish persistence in the cloud environment, while modifying the Windows Event Log to remove evidence of unauthorized access and evade detection. During lateral movement, Cobalt Strike was used to spawn processes with alternate PPIDs to mimic legitimate system activities and bypass security controls. Persistence mechanisms included writing configuration files to removable USB media for command relay in air-gapped networks, and leveraging PiKVM hardware to maintain remote system control through hardware-based access methods, ensuring continued access even after network-level mitigations. Incident responders noted that the campaign utilized multiple cloud regions for redundancy, with no significant impact on performance metrics reported by victims. Mitigation recommendations include monitoring for unauthorized GitHub repository changes, implementing strict software supply chain validation, and auditing cloud API usage for anomalous Runbook executions.",
