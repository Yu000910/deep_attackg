The initial access phase involved sending phishing messages posing as Microsoft Teams notifications to compromise corporate social media account credentials, followed by execution where malicious code was injected into update.ps1 to steal credentials from the target system. The actors then utilized the vSphere Web Services SDK to execute arbitrary commands on compromised guest VMs and imported cookie files from the victim's browser profile to hijack authenticated web sessions. For persistence and command and control, they installed TinyPilot alongside legitimate remote access tools for redundancy. In the exfiltration phase, the ransomware saved encryption keys to pastebin.com for later retrieval by the attackers. System logs from the victim environment showed routine network traffic spikes unrelated to the intrusion, and the company, a mid-sized financial services firm, reported no prior incidents in the last quarter. Additional noise included false positives from antivirus scans detecting benign PowerShell scripts.",
