APT-F47 likely conducts initial reconnaissance through scanning public Wi-Fi networks [T1669] to identify potential entry points. In one incident, the actors exploited Adobe Flash Player vulnerability CVE-2015-3113 and Internet Explorer vulnerability CVE-2014-1776 [T1203] to gain initial access on a target workstation. System logs from the compromised machine show that the malware automatically connected to an open Wi-Fi network to establish external command and control (C2) communication [T1669]. Following exploitation, the adversary employed mshta.exe to execute a malicious HTA file [T1218.005], which ran PowerShell commands to download additional payloads from a web service [T1102], specifically leveraging Microsoft's OneDrive for stealthy retrieval. For persistence, the backdoor replaced the Master Boot Record to ensure execution prior to OS initialization [T1542.003] and added a registry subkey to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\ to achieve boot execution [T1547.003], while also modifying the system's lock screen timeout settings to prevent automatic logout and maintain access [T1653]. The attacker executed 'systemctl start network-sniffer.service' to begin monitoring network traffic on the target machine [T1569.003] and used Mimikatz.exe to extract NTLM hashes from the LSASS process memory for lateral movement via pass-the-hash attacks [T1550.002]. Calisto malware collected Keychain storage data and copied passwords/tokens to a file [T1555.001], and malicious automation was configured to collect all accessible GitHub gists containing code snippets and credentials [T1213.003]. To evade detection, the exploit kit wrote misleading information to /proc/5179/cmdline to bypass process-based defenses [T1036.011]. In cloud environments, the malware programmatically created numerous SNS topics and subscriptions, consuming AWS resources and degrading service performance through cloud service hijacking [T1496.004]. Incident responders noted anomalous network traffic spikes correlating with these activities, but no data exfiltration was confirmed in this simulation. The company background involves a mid-sized fintech firm with hybrid infrastructure, and routine system audits revealed no prior compromises.
