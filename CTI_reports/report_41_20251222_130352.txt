CrimsonTide actors initiated their campaign by conducting reconnaissance to gather employee credentials through phishing messages distributed via social media [T1589.001]. They then modified DNS A records for a corporate login portal to redirect traffic to their phishing server, enabling adversary-in-the-middle attacks [T1557] to capture additional credentials [T1584.002]. Upon gaining initial access, the actors exploited a default Administrator account with the password 'admin123' to move laterally within the network [T1078.001]. In a parallel effort, they sent spearphishing emails with links that automatically downloaded and executed a remote access tool when clicked [T1566.004], using Visual Basic scripts [T1059.005] to deploy NanoCore malware. The actors further abused Azure Run Command to execute 'net user' commands and create backdoor accounts on virtual machines [T1059.009], while also using CreateProcessWithTokenW to spawn a new explorer.exe process with SYSTEM-level permissions [T1134.002]. Through Azure Serial Console, they obtained console-level access to a virtual machine despite firewall restrictions [T1021.008], leveraging remote administration tools [T1219] for persistent infiltration. The malware collected sensitive documents and prepared them for transmission to webhook.site [T1567.004], and finally, the attacker's script used 'format C:' to completely erase the system partition and disable boot capabilities [T1561.002]. System logs from the targeted environment showed routine network traffic spikes unrelated to the attack, and the company's background includes a recent merger that expanded its digital footprint, though this did not directly facilitate the intrusion.
