On 2023-10-15, security analysts at 'Global Finance Corp' detected anomalous network traffic from internal systems, leading to the discovery of a coordinated attack. The initial intrusion began when attackers compromised the build server of a third-party software vendor, replacing the authentic installer for a financial analytics tool with a malicious executable that included credential-stealing malware [T1195.002]. Upon installation by unsuspecting users, the malware exploited CVE-2011-4369 in Adobe Reader [T1203] to execute payloads that modified desktop shortcuts to launch ransomware upon user login [T1547.009] and altered world-writable cron jobs for privilege escalation at system startup [T1548.004]. The malicious code incorporated execution guardrails by verifying user-agent strings to avoid sandbox environments [T1480] and used Set-InboxRule to hide C2 communication emails in hidden folders [T1564.008]. During lateral movement, the actors extracted Slack Workflows containing unsecured API credentials [T1552.008] and tainted shared content by placing malware on file shares with names mimicking legitimate documents [T1080]. Network manipulation involved DHCP spoofing to overwrite client machine settings [T1557.003] and abuse of a PiKVM device for redundant control over critical infrastructure [T1219.003]. Data exfiltration was conducted through custom HTTP Accept headers for protocol impersonation [T1001.003], exfiltration over the Microsoft Outlook C2 channel [T1041], and uploading stolen documents to text storage sites using a PowerShell script named 'malicious.ps1' [T1567.003]. System logs from the affected servers showed increased CPU usage and unusual outbound connections to IP addresses in Eastern Europe, though these were initially dismissed as false positives during routine maintenance. Global Finance Corp, a multinational bank with operations in over 50 countries, reported no financial losses but noted minor disruptions in internal communication systems, which were restored within 48 hours after containment efforts.
