The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign. Crimson Serpent actors initiated their operation by conducting reconnaissance [T1595.002] to identify vulnerabilities in Apache services, while simultaneously querying public databases like Censys [T1596.005] to locate SSH servers with weak encryption. Following this, they deployed a malicious Office document with embedded macros [T1592] to gather detailed host information from initial victims. In a parallel effort, the group compromised a software supply chain [T1195.002] by replacing a legitimate application with a trojanized version on an official download server. To gain initial access, they used spearphishing emails containing malicious links [T1204.001] that directed users to download the compromised software. Once inside the network, the malware established encrypted VPN tunnels [T1665] to conceal command-and-control traffic from security monitoring. Finally, the actors exfiltrated sensitive data to cloud storage services like mega.nz using tools such as Rclone [T1567.002]. Background logs from victim systems showed routine Apache access attempts and SSH connection failures, which are typical noise in enterprise environments but were leveraged by the threat actors for initial scanning.
