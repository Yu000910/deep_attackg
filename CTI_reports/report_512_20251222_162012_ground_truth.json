    "clean_text": "In late 2023, TechNova Solutions, a company specializing in cloud-based software development with offices in San Francisco and London, reported anomalous network activity. Initial logs from their SIEM showed unusual outbound traffic patterns, but routine firewall checks revealed no immediate breaches. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by automatically collecting employee names from public-facing staff biographies on the company website and purchased firewall configuration details from a dark web technical information broker to map network defenses. To obtain capabilities, an adversary downloaded a credential harvesting tool from a hacker website. For initial access, attackers impersonated organization IT staff, instructing victims via phishing emails to execute commercial remote access tools, leading to user execution. Once inside, the malware employed PowerShell to download additional payloads while simultaneously querying registry keys to check for specific entries like HKU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\CTF before decoding embedded data. The malicious process used NtQueryInformationProcess() with ProcessDebugPort to detect if it was being debugged, evading analysis, and attempted to find the process ID of the current process for discovery. For persistence, attackers abused system-assigned managed identities in Azure to gain credential-less access to key vaults and storage. In command and control, the malware utilized domain generation algorithms for resilient communication. Finally, for impact, malicious actors deployed botnet malware to harness network resources for credential stuffing attacks, hijacking bandwidth. TechNova's incident response team noted that standard antivirus scans initially missed the payload due to its obfuscated nature, and cloud audit logs showed sporadic access anomalies over a two-week period before detection.",
