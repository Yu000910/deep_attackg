Background: ShadowVeil is a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group assessed to target critical infrastructure sectors, including energy and finance. This report simulates their activities based on hypothetical intelligence. On 2024-10-01, a mid-sized utility company, 'PowerGrid Inc.', reported anomalous network traffic from its VPN servers, leading to the discovery of this campaign.

Initial Access: The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by purchasing stolen employee credentials from dark web marketplaces [T1597] and sent spearphishing emails with malicious links [T1566.002] to collect VPN configuration details [T1592.004], exploiting a compromised ISP channel to redirect user traffic through a malicious proxy [T1659]. System logs from PowerGrid Inc. show increased failed login attempts on October 2, but these were initially dismissed as noise.

Execution and Persistence: Upon gaining access, the adversary employed PowerShell to create system services [T1569.003] and scheduled tasks [T1053] for executing malicious payloads, using port knocking [T1205.001] to establish covert command and control (C2) channels. The malware dumped LSA secrets [T1003.004] and enumerated Windows Credential Manager [T1555.004] to harvest cached domain credentials, while tools like AdFind were used for remote system discovery [T1018].

Lateral Movement and Impact: The actors leveraged RDP hijacking [T1563.002] and configured VNC services on non-standard ports [T1219.002] for stealthy remote access, leading to application exhaustion floods [T1499.003] that overwhelmed database servers. PowerGrid Inc.'s internal audit revealed unauthorized modifications to firewall rules, but no data exfiltration was confirmed in this simulation.

Recommendations: Blue teams should monitor for unusual credential usage, implement multi-factor authentication, and review scheduled tasks and service configurations regularly. This scenario highlights the importance of layered defenses against credential-based attacks and lateral movement.
