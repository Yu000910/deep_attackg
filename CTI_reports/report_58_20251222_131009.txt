APT-FICT actors initiated their campaign by exploiting compromised valid accounts [T1078] to gain initial access to the target network, leveraging stolen credentials from a previous breach. Upon entry, they employed Python scripts [T1059.006] to execute malicious code that exfiltrated sensitive data [T1567] while simultaneously using non-application layer protocols like ICMP [T1095] for command and control communications to evade detection. To establish persistence, the actors created systemd timers [T1053.006] on Linux systems, scheduling periodic execution of payloads. For lateral movement, they transferred tools via network shares [T1570] and modified domain policies [T1484] to weaken security settings across the tenant. During exfiltration, data was hidden using steganography in image files [T1001.002] and transmitted over web services [T1567]. System logs from the compromised domain controller showed unusual login attempts at 03:00 UTC, and network traffic analysis revealed spikes in ICMP packets, though some alerts were false positives from routine maintenance scripts. The company, a mid-sized financial services firm with offices in three countries, reported no immediate financial loss but noted increased help desk tickets for password resets during the incident period.
