    "clean_text": "Background: 'ShadowGale' is a suspected state-sponsored actor with origins in Eastern Europe, known for targeting global financial networks since 2022. In this fictional scenario, the group focuses on mid-sized banks in North America, leveraging social engineering and cloud-based resources. Initial analysis of network logs from a compromised bank, 'SecureBank Inc.', revealed anomalous DNS queries and unauthorized SSH connections starting in early 2024, with no prior incidents reported in their SIEM.\n\nAttack Narrative: The actors likely conduct reconnaissance by compromising legitimate domains and setting up virtual private servers (VPS) to host command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, while simultaneously obtaining digital certificates to encrypt communications and evade detection. They then initiated the attack by sending spearphishing emails with malicious links to key employees at SecureBank, which, when clicked, downloaded a payload that created a scheduled task to execute a keylogger every hour and modified login hooks to run a data exfiltration script upon user authentication. After gaining initial access, the malware performed file and directory discovery to locate sensitive financial documents and invoked system location discovery to determine the victim's geographical location, while the actors used password cracking on weak credentials extracted from configuration files. For lateral movement, they exploited SSH hijacking across misconfigured servers and utilized mail protocols to exfiltrate data via SMTP channels. Finally, the attack concluded with a system shutdown/reboot triggered by a wiper tool to disrupt operations and cover tracks, as observed in reboot logs from affected endpoints at SecureBank's data center in Chicago.\n\nIrrelevant Information: SecureBank Inc. was founded in 1995 and operates 50 branches across the Midwest, with annual revenue of $500 million. Their IT team uses a mix of Windows and Linux systems, and routine vulnerability scans last week showed no critical issues. Employee training on phishing awareness was conducted quarterly, but one user reported a suspicious email from 'support@secure-update[.]com' that was not flagged by the spam filter.",
