Crimson Lotus actors initiated their campaign by conducting reconnaissance through phishing emails [T1598] that spoofed security alerts from legitimate sources, directing users to malicious websites designed to harvest credentials. Concurrently, they stole a digital signature from Adobe Systems [T1588.004] to sign their MaoCheng dropper, enhancing its evasion capabilities. The actors then exploited a compromised corporate Twitter account [T1566.003] to disseminate malicious links disguised as critical security updates, further expanding their initial access. Upon compromise, they employed PowerShell [T1059.001] to execute scripts that downloaded additional payloads while modifying system configurations for persistence. On macOS systems, they used 'launchctl submit -l com.exploit.service -p /tmp/exploit' [T1569.001] to submit jobs as system services, ensuring continued execution. For deeper persistence, Crimson Lotus modified a custom kernel module [T1547.006] to embed backdoor functionality, allowing covert access even after reboots. In the network phase, they abused DHCP ACK messages [T1557.003] to push malicious DNS server configurations, redirecting traffic to adversary-controlled servers. The actors then conducted cloud storage object discovery [T1619] by enumerating AWS S3 buckets and Elastic Block Store volumes to identify sensitive data for exfiltration. They exploited SSH [T1021.004] to remotely control compromised Linux servers, facilitating lateral movement across the environment. For data exfiltration, they employed XMPP file transfer capabilities [T1071.005] to send documents while blending in with normal chat traffic, evading network monitoring. Additionally, they used botnet malware.exe [T1496.002] to hijack network bandwidth for running unauthorized proxy services, further obscuring their activities. System logs from the targeted organization, 'TechGlobal Inc.', showed anomalous login attempts from IP addresses in Eastern Europe, though these were unrelated to the core attack chain. TechGlobal Inc., a mid-sized cloud services provider, reported no financial losses but experienced minor service disruptions during the incident, which were resolved within 48 hours through standard incident response procedures.
