The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign designated 'SilentProxy'. This campaign targets financial organizations, with initial access achieved through compromised file-sharing web services [T1583.006], where malicious payloads were hosted and distributed to employees via phishing links. Upon execution, the malware exploited a compromised ISP channel to inject malicious content [T1659], redirecting user traffic through a proxy server that intercepted HTTP requests. System logs from the victim's network showed unusual spikes in outbound traffic to unknown IP addresses, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured firewall rules. The actors then employed native API calls [T1106] to manipulate system processes and exploit vulnerabilities like MS14-068 [T1212] to forge Kerberos tickets, bypassing authentication controls while simultaneously using network sniffing tools [T1040] to capture credentials from unencrypted traffic on internal subnets. For evasion, the malware implemented time-based checks [T1497.003] by calling GetTickCount API twice to detect emulation environments, delaying malicious activities if acceleration was detected. To maintain access, the actors extracted web session cookies [T1550.004] from browser profiles, restoring authenticated sessions to bypass multi-factor authentication, and staged exfiltrated data remotely [T1074.002] by copying files to compromised web servers for later download. Additionally, the campaign queried messaging applications [T1213.005] like Microsoft Teams to collect credentials from private channels, captured audio [T1123] via microphone access to monitor user authentication processes, and used traffic signaling [T1205] to intercept TCP handshake packets, verifying implant-specific values before allowing legitimate traffic to pass. Background checks revealed the organization had recently migrated to cloud services, but this was unrelated to the attack vector.
