The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional APT campaign. Background: The targeted organization, 'FinSecure Bank', reported anomalous network traffic and unauthorized access attempts starting in early 2024. Initial logs from their SIEM showed increased outbound connections to unknown IP addresses, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured thresholds.

Attack Scenario: The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify FinSecure's network topology and employee roles. In the Initial Access phase, the adversary rented a Virtual Private Server (VPS) from DigitalOcean using stolen payment information to host their command and control infrastructure [T1583.003] and acquired a banking trojan through a criminal forum transaction [T1588.001]. Network administrators later discovered a passive network tap connected to the main switch in the server room, indicating physical hardware additions [T1200] for data interception.

In the Execution phase, the malware employed Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) [T1047] to delete shadow copies and utilized EnumWindows to identify all active windows for ListPlanting [T1055.015], injecting into a legitimate process to evade detection. For Persistence, the actors altered termsrv.dll to disable RDP security features [T1505.005], installed a backdoored vSphere Installation Bundle (VIB) payload on the ESXi hypervisor [T1505.006], and created a /Library/StartupItems directory on macOS systems to house malicious startup scripts [T1037.005]. Additionally, the malware bypassed Gatekeeper by downloading a mach-o binary using curl without setting the quarantine flag [T1553.001].

In the Defense Evasion and Command and Control phases, the threat actor used certutil -encode to encode a backdoor script as a certificate file, stealing or forging authentication certificates [T1649], and leveraged a compromised Visual Studio Code instance to tunnel network traffic through its integrated terminal via IDE Tunneling [T1219.001]. Unrelated logs from FinSecure's firewall showed routine HTTP requests to cloud services, which were not part of the attack. The campaign resulted in data exfiltration of customer financial records, with estimated impact including operational disruption and reputational damage. Mitigation recommendations include monitoring for unusual WMI activity, securing physical access to network hardware, and implementing application allowlisting.
