The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign designated 'SilentReaper'. This campaign targets corporate environments through a multi-stage attack chain. Initial reconnaissance involved actors querying Facebook profiles of executives to gather information about physical office locations [T1591.001], which was used to tailor spear-phishing emails. Following initial access via a compromised software update, the adversary employed PowerShell [T1195.001] to inject malicious code into update.ps1, stealing browser cookies and session data while simultaneously monitoring Windows message loop events to log user keyboard input [T1674]. System logs from infected hosts show increased CPU usage during these activities, though no alerts were triggered initially. To evade detection, the malware modified registry keys [T1562] to disable Windows Firewall across all network profiles and used a Revenge RAT plugin for screen capture [T1113]. Internal network enumeration was conducted using a SharePoint tool known as spwebmember [T1213.002], which dumped sensitive documents from corporate portals. For lateral movement, the actors leveraged Inveigh to perform LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning and SMB relay attacks [T1557.001], capturing credentials from multiple departments. Command and control was established via a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) [T1568.002] that derived URLs from a word list, with exfiltration occurring over unencrypted FTP protocols [T1048.003] to external servers. Finally, the malware initiated a system shutdown [T1529] to cover tracks after data theft, mimicking routine maintenance reboots. Network traffic analysis revealed anomalous FTP connections during off-hours, but no immediate action was taken due to misconfigured alerts.
