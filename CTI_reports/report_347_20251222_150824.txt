Background: 'ShadowLink' is a fictional APT group with suspected ties to cybercriminal syndicates, focusing on financial data exfiltration. In this training scenario, they targeted a mid-sized bank, 'SecureBank Inc.', which uses third-party software for internal financial management. The attack began with the compromise of a software vendor's build server, where the actors injected malicious code into a legitimate accounting application update [T1195.002]. Upon deployment at SecureBank, the malware executed a scheduled task using Win32_ScheduledJob to run a PowerShell script every Friday at 2:00 AM, which initiated data collection and exfiltration routines [T1053.002]. System logs from SecureBank's SIEM showed unusual PowerShell activity during off-hours, but initial alerts were dismissed as false positives due to noise from routine maintenance scripts. The malware then leveraged Fgdump to extract password hashes from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database [T1003.002], enabling credential theft for lateral movement. Using these credentials, the actors established a VNC connection to monitor victim systems and gather network topology information to identify high-value targets, such as database servers containing customer financial records [T1021.005]. They subsequently hijacked an application access token from a compromised user session to query SecureBank's internal financial API, attempting unauthorized fund transfers [T1550.001]. Throughout the campaign, command and control (C2) communications were obfuscated using DNS queries to blend with normal network traffic, with Mythic profiles facilitating data exfiltration over DNS channels [T1071.004]. Incident responders noted anomalous DNS requests to unknown domains, but initial investigations were hampered by limited logging on internal DNS servers. The attack was simulated to end with data exfiltration of sensitive financial information, emphasizing the need for enhanced supply chain security and network monitoring.
