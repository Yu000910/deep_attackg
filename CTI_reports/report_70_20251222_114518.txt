The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the fictional threat actor DOCKERPHANTOM. This group has been observed conducting sophisticated attacks against cloud-native infrastructures, leveraging containerization technologies for initial access and persistence.

Initial Access: DOCKERPHANTOM actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] by enumerating domain accounts [T1087.002] to identify potential targets. They then upload backdoored Docker images to public repositories like Docker Hub [T1608.001], which include malicious Dockerfiles that silently install keylogging software during container builds [T1204.003].

Execution: Upon deployment, the adversary uses service execution tools similar to PsExec [T1569.002] to run malicious scripts, while simultaneously performing system location discovery [T1614] by querying cloud instance metadata services to gather region and availability zone details. The malware also conducts security software discovery [T1518.001] to identify installed anti-virus products on compromised hosts.

Persistence: To maintain access, the actors modify RC scripts [T1037.004] to launch keylogger processes during every boot sequence, and they leverage software deployment tools like AWS Systems Manager [T1072] to execute commands that modify firewall rules across EC2 instances.

Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement: By mounting the Docker socket into containers, DOCKERPHANTOM gains control over the host's Docker daemon to escape to the host [T1611]. They then use Wi-Fi network scanning [T1669] to list available access points for potential lateral movement, and access code repositories via git hooks [T1213.003] to automatically collect and exfiltrate code changes.

Collection and Exfiltration: The threat actors stage local data by copying files from removable drives to designated directories [T1074.001], and they leverage SharePoint permissions [T1213.002] to access and exfiltrate customer databases. Additionally, they extract Slack workflows from chat messages [T1552.008] to harvest embedded access keys. For command and control (C2) communications, DOCKERPHANTOM employs DNS tunneling [T1071.004] to evade detection.

Irrelevant Information: During the investigation, system logs from a fictional company, CloudTech Inc., showed routine backup processes running every 4 hours, with no anomalies detected in network traffic patterns. The company, which specializes in SaaS solutions, reported normal operational metrics during the simulated incident timeframe. Background checks revealed that employees had recently completed mandatory cybersecurity training, but no direct correlation to the attack was found.
