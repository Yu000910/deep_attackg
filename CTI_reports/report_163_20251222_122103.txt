The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional attack scenario. The threat actor 'HomeLand Justice' likely conducted reconnaissance by scanning the client's network with Nmap to gather information about active hosts and client configurations [T1592.004], while simultaneously collecting publicly available contact information from professional networking sites such as LinkedIn [T1593.001]. During the campaign, the actors used tools including Advanced Port Scanner, Mimikatz, and Impacket [T1588.002] to facilitate their operations. Initial access was achieved by exploiting the default Administrator password 'admin123' on a vulnerable server [T1078.001], and the malware H1N1 was deployed with functionality to copy itself to removable media for lateral movement [T1091]. Execution involved the attacker writing a malicious Dockerfile that included a hidden cryptocurrency miner in the build process [T1204.003], and persistence was established by executing assoc.exe to associate .log files with a malicious script for persistent access [T1546.001]. The actors then employed Set-ADUser commands to alter RADIUS configuration, allowing plaintext password capture via CHAP authentication [T1556.005], and used a credential harvesting tool to locate and copy Chrome browser login data from the local profile [T1555]. Lateral movement was conducted through winrm commands to remotely modify firewall settings on the Windows server [T1021.006], and command and control was maintained using a custom TCP protocol for C2 communications [T1095]. Data exfiltration involved leveraging the AWS CLI to copy S3 buckets containing intellectual property to an adversary-owned AWS account [T1537], while ObliqueRAT was used to break large files of interest into smaller chunks to prepare them for exfiltration [T1030]. The campaign concluded with the script injecting 'evil.ps1' to distort graphical elements in the user interface as a defacement tactic [T1491]. Background noise includes system logs showing routine updates at 03:00 UTC and company details about a fictional manufacturing firm, 'TechCorp Inc.', with no direct relevance to the attack. The actors' activities were detected through anomalous network traffic patterns and elevated privilege usage alerts.
