The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide a fictional, educational overview of simulated malicious activity attributed to the threat actor 'Cobalt Turla'. This report is based on a training scenario and does not reflect real-world incidents. The actors initiated their campaign by sending targeted spearphishing emails with malicious links [T1566.002], which directed victims to download documents containing embedded Visual Basic scripts [T1059.005]. Upon execution, these scripts attempted to exploit world-writable system files to achieve privilege escalation [T1548.004], allowing the adversary to install credential harvesting tools. System logs from the victim's endpoint showed unusual process creation events at 14:32 UTC, but initial alerts were dismissed as false positives due to high network traffic. Following initial compromise, the actors used rsync to laterally transfer remote access tools to additional systems within the network [T1570], while simultaneously modifying directory.lnk files on a shared drive to redirect users to malicious executables [T1080]. During this phase, the malware captured screenshots of the victim's desktop [T1113] and employed SMB protocol queries to discover shared folders containing IT infrastructure documentation [T1602]. Background checks on the compromised systems revealed outdated software patches, though this was unrelated to the attack vector. To evade detection, the actors utilized a custom Python script that calculated DNS query patterns to bypass network egress filters [T1568.003], facilitating data exfiltration. The company's internal investigation noted increased DNS traffic during off-hours, but no immediate action was taken. This scenario underscores the importance of monitoring for multi-stage attacks and implementing robust security controls.
