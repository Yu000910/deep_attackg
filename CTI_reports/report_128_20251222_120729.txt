The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign, 'Cobalt Octopus'. This campaign targets organizations using cloud and container technologies, with observed activity between January and March 2024. Actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify vulnerable systems. In the attack, the adversary exploited a public-facing application [T1190] by targeting a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2024-39717) in Versa Director servers to gain initial access and execute code. Upon compromise, the malware was designed to automatically find and join any open wireless network [T1669] for command and control, while simultaneously using a modified version of Invoke-Ngrok to expose open local ports to the internet [T1090] as a proxy. System logs from the compromised server show unusual SSH connections at 03:45 UTC, but these were unrelated to the initial breach. The actors then leveraged 'docker exec' [T1609] to run reconnaissance scripts inside a production container, and modified user roles in the cloud environment to include Global Administrator [T1098.003] for persistent control. For persistence on Windows hosts, a backdoor DLL named 'svchost_helper.dll' was dropped and registered via AppCertDLLs [T1546.009]. The company, a mid-sized financial services firm, reported no prior incidents in Q4 2023. Additionally, the malware used Cobalt Strike to SSH to a remote service [T1021.004] for lateral movement, and collected browser session files to hijack authenticated sessions and bypass MFA [T1550.004]. In one instance, PowerShell commands were executed to set up Exchange transport rules that forward executive emails to a malicious recipient [T1114.003]. Collected information, such as financial records, was stored in the Application Data directory on compromised hosts [T1074.001] before exfiltration. Finally, hackers leveraged Bluetooth protocol flaws to covertly transmit this staged data to an external receiver [T1011.001]. Network traffic analysis indicated normal backup operations during the exfiltration phase, which was not part of the attack.
