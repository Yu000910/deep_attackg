The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training insights into a fictional APT campaign. ShadowHawk actors likely conduct reconnaissance by gathering victim organization information [T1591] through searches on Instagram for posts tagged with the company's location to map employee movements, while simultaneously identifying business tempo [T1591.003] by querying the victim's official blog to collect details on product release schedules. Following this, the adversary exploited public-facing applications [T1190] using vulnerabilities in Apache Struts, Oracle WebLogic (CVE-2017-10271), and Adobe ColdFusion (CVE-2017-3066) to deliver malware and gain initial access. Upon compromise, the attackers executed AppleScript commands [T1059.002] via osascript to enumerate running processes and system information, and established persistence by modifying the Winlogon Helper DLL registry key [T1547.004] at HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify to trigger malicious code during the Windows logon process. Data was then staged [T1074] using a script that ran 'cmd.exe /c type C:\Documents\*.docx >> C:\Temp\exfil_data.txt' to append document contents to a staging file, and exfiltration was obfuscated by adding junk data [T1001.001] to outgoing UDP packets to peer implants. System logs from the victim's network showed routine traffic spikes unrelated to the attack, and the company's background includes a focus on software development with offices in multiple regions, which provided additional context for the reconnaissance phase.
