Crimson Tempest initiated the attack by conducting spearphishing voice calls [T1566.004] to employees at a fictional energy company, 'GridSecure Inc.', leveraging social engineering to harvest valid account credentials [T1078] from unsuspecting victims. The company, which operates SCADA systems for power distribution, reported anomalous login attempts from external IP addresses during off-peak hours, though initial firewall logs showed no immediate alerts. Using these credentials, the actors gained initial access to a development environment where they employed AWS Systems Manager Run Command [T1072] to deploy a backdoor across managed instances while simultaneously using PowerShell for process discovery [T1057] to identify running services on victim machines. In the containerized infrastructure, the adversary executed a container administration command [T1609] to establish a reverse shell from within a target container and configured a malicious CronJob [T1053.007] to schedule data exfiltration during low-activity periods. For persistence, they wrote a malicious DLL named monsvc.dll to the Windows system folder for port monitor hijacking [T1547.010] and modified the registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NetworkProvider\Order [T1556.008] to prioritize a credential-capturing network provider, while also dropping implants in folders named for legitimate software [T1036.005] to evade detection. During execution, the actors used process argument spoofing [T1564.010] in spawned processes to execute beacon commands and leveraged a compromised Visual Studio Code installation [T1219.001] to establish persistent remote control via custom workspace settings. For data handling, they archived stolen data using RC4 encryption and Base64 encoding [T1560.003] prior to exfiltration over webhooks [T1567.004] to external sites like webhook.site, and in air-gapped segments, they wrote command scripts to USB flash drives [T1092] for manual execution. System administrators noted unusual spikes in network traffic from container orchestration jobs, but routine audits initially missed the subtle registry modifications.
