APT-FICT, a fictional threat actor with suspected state-sponsored ties, has been observed conducting targeted campaigns against organizations in the energy and manufacturing sectors since early 2024. Initial analysis indicates the group leverages open-source intelligence (OSINT) to profile potential victims, though specific reconnaissance techniques remain unconfirmed in this scenario. The attack begins with spearphishing emails [T1566.002] that contain malicious links disguised as legitimate software updates, which, when clicked by users, trigger the execution of a compromised DLL file [T1195.001] embedded in a popular development tool, leading to the download and execution of a remote access tool (RAT) via user interaction with a malicious Word document [T1204]. Once established, the malware exploits a vulnerability in a VNC client [T1021.005] to facilitate lateral movement across the network while using Tor-based multi-hop proxies [T1090.003] to communicate with C2 servers, and it actively deletes Shadow Volume copies [T1490] to hinder forensic recovery efforts. Logs from affected systems show increased network traffic to suspicious IP addresses, but no direct evidence of data exfiltration was found in this simulation. The company background involves a mid-sized utility provider with outdated patch management processes, contributing to the initial compromise.
