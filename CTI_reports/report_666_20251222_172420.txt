CrimsonTide, a suspected state-sponsored group, has been observed targeting energy companies, with a focus on those using cloud infrastructure. The campaign begins with reconnaissance, where actors likely gather employee information from social media and public databases [T1589]. To establish initial access, the adversary planted a USB Rubber Ducky in a corporate breakroom [T1200], exploiting human curiosity, and simultaneously conducted drive-by compromises by injecting malicious scripts into compromised websites and Google Ads to lure victims into downloading a malicious installer [T1189]. Once access was gained, the actors executed a custom downloader malware [T1587.001] using PowerShell to invoke cloud APIs [T1059.009], which allowed them to remotely run commands via Azure Runbooks while hijacking AWS Route53 configurations to redirect legitimate domain traffic to malicious servers [T1584.001]. For persistence and data exfiltration, CrimsonTide accessed files containing credentials [T1552.001], such as configuration files with plaintext passwords, and used dead drop resolvers by embedding encrypted C2 server names in an RSS feed on Livejournal and hiding IP addresses within Bitcoin blockchain transactions [T1102.001]. To evade network detection, the group employed domain fronting by manipulating HTTP Host Headers to route traffic through trusted domains [T1090.004]. Finally, to disrupt operations, the actors stopped critical services [T1489], such as security monitoring tools, to hinder response efforts. Throughout the incident, system logs showed routine network traffic spikes unrelated to the attack, and the targeted company, 'EnergyFlow Inc.', had recently migrated to hybrid cloud environments, though this background did not directly correlate with the intrusion vectors.
