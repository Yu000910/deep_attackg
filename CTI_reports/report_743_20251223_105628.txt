On October 15, 2024, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA identified a fictional campaign, dubbed 'ShadowHook,' targeting technology firms and financial institutions. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify supply chain vulnerabilities. In the Initial Access phase, the adversary compromised the hardware supply chain by reprogramming a Teensy USB device to mount as a storage device containing malware for automatic execution [T1195.003]. Upon insertion into a target macOS system, the malware executed via the Windows Command Shell [T1059.003] to run cmd.exe with parameters, while simultaneously employing dscl commands to hide backdoor accounts from the macOS login screens [T1564.002]. System logs from the affected host, 'CorpMac-01,' showed unusual process spawns at 03:45 UTC, though these were initially dismissed as routine maintenance. In the Execution phase, the actors manipulated CMSTP.exe to execute a DLL containing backdoor code [T1218.003], which then hooked the GetUserNameW function to capture Windows usernames during authentication [T1056.004]. Network traffic analysis revealed a suspicious DNS A record registered for 'cdn-service.org' to mask malicious traffic as legitimate content delivery [T1568.001]. Irrelevant background: The targeted company, 'TechGlobal Inc.,' reported no prior incidents in Q3 2024. For exfiltration, stolen user credentials were packaged and transferred via FTP to a remote host [T1048], and in the Impact phase, the malware leveraged a botnet to overwhelm the DNS server with recursive queries [T1498], causing service disruptions noted in internal incident reports.
