Crimson Serpent, a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, initiated their campaign against SecureFin Corp., a company with offices in New York and London specializing in digital payment solutions. The actors first conducted reconnaissance by purchasing technical data from a commercial IP geolocation database to map the physical locations of the victim's servers [T1597.002] and simultaneously used nmap to scan for network security appliances, identifying firewall configurations and open ports on the target network [T1590.006]. SecureFin's internal logs from this period show routine system updates, but no alerts were triggered during this phase. Following reconnaissance, the adversary deployed custom-built malware, including variants similar to DCSrv and PyDCrypt, which were designed to establish initial footholds on victim machines [T1587.001]. They leveraged harvested valid administrative credentials, obtained through previous breaches, to facilitate lateral movement across the network [T1078] and executed container administration commands via the kubelet API to run malicious processes within Kubernetes environments [T1609]. During lateral movement, the actors exploited network address translation traversal to bypass port-based filtering restrictions on corporate firewalls [T1599.001] and used privilege escalation techniques to gain read access to /etc/shadow for hash extraction from Linux systems [T1003.008]. Additionally, they queried shared folders via SMB protocol to extract data from configuration repositories containing sensitive IT infrastructure documentation [T1602] and employed LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning with SMB relay attacks using tools like ntlmrelayx to gather NetNTLM credentials for further exploitation [T1557.001]. To maintain stealth, Crimson Serpent established an SSH tunnel for protocol tunneling to bypass firewall restrictions and exfiltrate stolen data [T1572] while installing a malicious Windows Service as a remote access tool to maintain interactive control over compromised hosts [T1219]. Finally, the adversary ran commands such as 'sc delete LogCollector' to clear persistence mechanisms and avoid detection [T1070.009]. Incident responders noted anomalous network traffic spikes during off-hours, but initial investigations were inconclusive due to encrypted payloads.
