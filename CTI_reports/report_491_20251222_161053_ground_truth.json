    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training insights into a fictional APT campaign. ShadowHawk actors likely conduct reconnaissance by gathering victim organization information through searches on Instagram for posts tagged with the company's location to map employee movements, while simultaneously identifying business tempo by querying the victim's official blog to collect details on product release schedules. Following this, the adversary exploited public-facing applications using vulnerabilities in Apache Struts, Oracle WebLogic (CVE-2017-10271), and Adobe ColdFusion (CVE-2017-3066) to deliver malware and gain initial access. Upon compromise, the attackers executed AppleScript commands via osascript to enumerate running processes and system information, and established persistence by modifying the Winlogon Helper DLL registry key at HKLM\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Notify to trigger malicious code during the Windows logon process. Data was then staged using a script that ran 'cmd.exe /c type C:\\Documents\\*.docx >> C:\\Temp\\exfil_data.txt' to append document contents to a staging file, and exfiltration was obfuscated by adding junk data to outgoing UDP packets to peer implants. System logs from the victim's network showed routine traffic spikes unrelated to the attack, and the company's background includes a focus on software development with offices in multiple regions, which provided additional context for the reconnaissance phase.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, designated as 'ShadowHawk', targeting corporate entities in the technology sector. Based on analysis of fictional incident response data, ShadowHawk employs a multi-phase approach involving reconnaissance, exploitation, persistence, data staging, and exfiltration techniques. The campaign leverages publicly available information and known vulnerabilities to gain initial access, followed by execution of malicious scripts and establishment of persistence mechanisms. This report is intended for blue team training to enhance detection and response capabilities against similar tactics.",
