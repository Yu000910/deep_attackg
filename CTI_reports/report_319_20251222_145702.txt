The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign, 'ShadowGale', which targets financial organizations like GlobalTrust Bank, a mid-sized institution with assets of $50 billion and operations across North America and Europe. In this scenario, actors likely conduct reconnaissance by querying paid threat intelligence feeds [T1597.001] and purchasing system architecture documentation from dark web marketplaces [T1597.002] to gather details about the target's security tools and technical environment. Additionally, they used Google search operators, such as 'site:targetcompany.com filetype:pdf' [T1593.002], to locate internal documents like network diagrams and employee handbooks, which were found in unsecured SharePoint repositories during a routine audit log review (e.g., event ID 4688 showed anomalous access patterns). The actors then compromised a DNS server in a third-party data center [T1584], configuring it to serve malicious responses for specific domain queries, while simultaneously sending spear-phishing emails mimicking cloud service providers [T1586.003] to collect authentication details from IT staff, as evidenced by a spike in failed login attempts (e.g., 10 attempts in 5 minutes from IP 192.168.1.100). For data exfiltration, adversaries set up a shared Dropbox folder accessible only through burner accounts [T1585.003] and abused WebVPN traffic to targeted devices [T1190] to achieve unauthorized remote code execution, followed by configuring schtasks.exe to run a backdoor payload daily at 3 AM [T1053]. In cloud environments, the adversary leveraged the Azure Serial Console [T1021.008] to troubleshoot and manipulate a virtual machine's operating system directly, while the malware used DHCP protocol to redirect client traffic through an attacker-controlled proxy [T1557.003]. Data collection involved ROKRAT-like capabilities to gather host data and specific file types [T1005], with C2 communications using HTTP GET and POST requests [T1071.001], and a PowerShell script ran 'Set-LocalUser -Name 'serviceaccount' -PasswordNeverExpires $false' [T1531] to disrupt automated services, causing service outages reported in internal tickets (e.g., ticket #INC-2024-789).
