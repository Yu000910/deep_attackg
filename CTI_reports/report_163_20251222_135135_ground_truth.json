    "clean_text": "PowerGrid Inc., a mid-sized utility provider in the Midwest, reported anomalous network activity starting on October 15, 2023, after an employee found an unfamiliar USB device in the breakroom. Initial logs from their SIEM showed increased DNS queries from internal workstations, which were initially dismissed as benign. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by performing iterative DNS queries to map the organization's infrastructure while simultaneously gathering system boot information via commands like systeminfo. This phase included irrelevant background noise, such as routine software updates and failed login attempts from legacy systems, which obscured the malicious intent. Subsequently, the threat actor planted a USB Rubber Ducky disguised as a standard flash drive in the breakroom, which, when inserted by an unsuspecting employee, executed a payload that established persistence by creating scheduled tasks. The malicious code then employed Ptrace system calls to inject into legitimate processes and allocated memory for payload execution, while also leveraging cloud services by running Connect-AZAccount to access Azure resources. To evade detection, the actor used steganography tools to hide command and control (C2) traffic within PNG image files uploaded to a compromised cloud storage account. Additionally, a trojan was deployed that secretly installed mining software, hijacking system resources to generate cryptocurrency, which caused performance degradation noted in helpdesk tickets for unrelated issues like slow application load times. Throughout the campaign, normal business operations continued, with employees reporting minor IT glitches, such as intermittent VPN drops and printer errors, which were logged but not immediately linked to the attack.",

Based on analysis of simulated incident response data from a fictional energy company, 'PowerGrid Inc.', this report outlines the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used to gain initial access, establish persistence, execute malicious code, and exfiltrate data, incorporating realistic noise for training purposes. Blue teams are advised to review logs and implement mitigations as described.",
