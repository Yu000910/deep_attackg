The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide a fictional educational scenario for blue team training. This report outlines the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group 'ShadowGate' in a simulated attack against a mid-sized financial institution, 'SecureBank Corp.', based on logs from their internal SIEM system dated October 2023. SecureBank Corp., established in 1995, operates primarily in the Northeastern U.S. with 500 employees and uses a hybrid cloud infrastructure; initial detection occurred via anomalous network traffic alerts from their firewall, though no actual breach occurred as this is a training exercise.

The actors likely conducted reconnaissance through open-source intelligence (OSINT) to identify SecureBank's external services, though this is not tagged as per instructions. The attack began with the adversary exploiting a compromised VPN gateway [T1133] to establish remote access into the corporate network, bypassing perimeter defenses. Once inside, they impersonated IT support staff via phone calls to an employee, who was tricked into executing a malicious remote access tool [T1204], which then scheduled a remote AT job [T1053.002] to maintain persistence and download additional payloads. The malware leveraged the built-in Administrator account with default credentials [T1078.001] to propagate across the domain, while simultaneously querying registry keys to extract LSA secrets [T1552.002] for credential harvesting. For lateral movement, the actors conducted internal spearphishing campaigns [T1534] targeting other employees with tailored emails, and they used IMAP and SMTP protocols [T1071.003] to establish covert communication channels with command-and-control servers, exfiltrating data through encrypted email attachments. System logs showed increased CPU usage on several servers, but this was unrelated noise. The campaign concluded with the deployment of ransomware, though data exfiltration was prioritized, as indicated by network traffic spikes in outbound connections during off-hours.
