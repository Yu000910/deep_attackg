The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide a fictional, educational overview of APT 'Leviathan' activities. Leviathan, a state-sponsored group, has been observed targeting energy and financial sectors since early 2024. In this scenario, the actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify vulnerabilities in public-facing web servers. They then rapidly adapted public exploit proof-of-concept code [T1587.004] to exploit a critical vulnerability in a VPN service, gaining initial access. Once inside, the adversary used compromised credentials from a previous breach [T1078] to authenticate to internal systems and maintain persistence, while simultaneously employing a simulated HID USB device to inject keystrokes [T1674] and execute malicious commands on a workstation. The actors further exploited the ZeroLogon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) [T1210] to escalate privileges and move laterally across the network. To deliver payloads, they downloaded ransomware from a command and control server [T1588.001] using PowerShell scripts, and encoded command-and-control communications [T1001.002] by hiding data within legitimate image files to evade detection. System logs from the victim network showed unusual login attempts from IP addresses in Eastern Europe, but no actual data exfiltration occurred in this training scenario. The company, a mid-sized utility provider, reported no operational impact, but this exercise highlights the need for robust patch management and multi-factor authentication.
