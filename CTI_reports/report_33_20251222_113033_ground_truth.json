    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform organizations about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in the fictional 'ShadowHawk' campaign. Initial reconnaissance involved the adversary searching Instagram for photos tagged at the target company's office locations to gather victim org information. Subsequently, spearphishing emails were distributed containing malicious Excel attachments that, when opened, exploited Microsoft's DDE protocol for execution [T1566.001, T1559.002]. System logs from the target's email server showed increased traffic during this period, though unrelated to the attack. For lateral movement, the actors utilized Invoke-DCOM to leverage remote COM execution across the network while simultaneously establishing a SOCKS5 proxy on a compromised web server to obscure command and control traffic. On compromised hosts, persistence was achieved by altering the Autorun.inf file to launch payloads upon removable media connection, modifying Unix shell configuration files such as profile and login for bash and csh shells, and installing login items via AppleScript on macOS systems. Additionally, the registry key HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\NetworkProvider\\Order was altered to include a rogue network provider DLL. Background checks on the company revealed no prior incidents, but internal audits noted outdated software versions. The campaign demonstrates a blend of social engineering, fileless execution, and multi-platform persistence techniques.",
