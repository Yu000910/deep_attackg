The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign attributed to CURIUM. This report is based on simulated activities and includes realistic but fabricated details for educational purposes.

CURIUM, a fictional state-sponsored actor, has been observed targeting organizations in the energy and financial sectors since early 2024. The campaign begins with reconnaissance using fictitious social media accounts on platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook to establish trust with employees, often posing as attractive professionals to gather intelligence and facilitate phishing [T1585.001]. Following this, the actors exploit public-facing applications by chaining vulnerabilities CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 in Ivanti Connect Secure VPN appliances, enabling authentication bypass and command injection, with subsequent use of CVE-2024-21893 to bypass mitigations through server-side request forgery [T1190]. Upon gaining initial access, CURIUM employs inter-process communication by abusing Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to launch PowerShell scripts for local code execution while simultaneously bypassing security mechanisms like Gatekeeper by writing malicious executables to the Downloads folder with quarantine attributes removed [T1559, T1553.001]. The malware, identified as CHIMNEYSWEEP, extracts RC4 encrypted embedded payloads for privilege escalation and conducts credential harvesting by executing commands such as 'find /home -name id_rsa' to locate SSH private keys on Linux systems [T1027.009, T1552.004]. For command and control, the actors utilize DNS tunneling to exfiltrate data and maintain persistence, and they configure proxyware services to share network bandwidth with third-party applications, potentially for bandwidth hijacking or obfuscating traffic [T1071.004, T1496.002]. System logs from a compromised server show unusual DNS queries to domains like 'malicious-c2[.]com' and increased network traffic during off-hours, though some of this activity may be unrelated to the attack. The organization, a mid-sized utility company, reported no operational impact, but the simulation highlights the need for enhanced monitoring and patch management.
