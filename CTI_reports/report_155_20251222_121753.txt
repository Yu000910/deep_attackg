APT 'Crimson Shadow' has been observed targeting financial institutions and government agencies in a coordinated campaign. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to gather email addresses and system information, though no specific logs confirm this initial phase. On 2023-10-15, the attack began with phishing emails sent to employees, containing password-protected ZIP files with trojanized executables to bypass detection [T1566]. The emails included decoy messages urging victims to enable malicious content, such as fake invoices, to increase success rates [T1204.002]. Once executed, the malware leveraged PowerShell [T1059.001] to download encrypted command and control modules from a GitHub repository, staging capabilities for further exploitation [T1608]. On Windows systems, the malware invoked DCShadow.exe to create a backdoor user account in Active Directory, establishing persistence through a rogue domain controller [T1207]. Simultaneously, on legacy Linux systems, the threat actor executed '/etc/init.d/auditd stop' to disable audit logging, evading detection by modifying system defenses [T1562.012]. For lateral movement, the actors abused a patch management system for an anti-virus product, distributing wiper malware across the network via software deployment tools [T1072]. Command and control was maintained using DNS tunnelling tools like dnscat/2 and Iodine, facilitating covert communication over DNS protocols [T1071.004]. System logs from a compromised server show unusual network traffic on port 53, but no alerts were triggered due to disabled auditing. The campaign highlights the need for enhanced email filtering, endpoint monitoring, and network anomaly detection.
