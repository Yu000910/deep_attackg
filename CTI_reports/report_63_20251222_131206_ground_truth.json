    "clean_text": "On 2023-10-15, security analysts at FinSecure Bank detected anomalous network traffic from a partner's Office 365 account, leading to the discovery of the 'ShadowScribe' campaign. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by collecting organizational structure and employee details from a paid corporate intelligence service. Initial access was achieved by compromising an Office 365 partner account, abusing the trusted relationship to escalate privileges within the customer environment. Once inside, the adversary employed Python to execute PyDCrypt, which used WriteProcessMemory to modify the memory space of explorer.exe via KernelCallbackTable injection while simultaneously modifying registry keys to force Outlook.exe to run malicious.html at every startup. For data theft, the actors used steganography to hide stolen data inside image files stored on GitHub and compressed it using a RAR archiver tool. Exfiltration involved encoding C2 communications with modified Base64 and custom character substitutions, dividing payloads into fixed-size chunks to evade detection, and configuring automated scripts to exfiltrate files under specified directories. Logs from FinSecure's SIEM showed increased outbound traffic to unknown IPs, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to the stealthy nature of the techniques. The bank's incident response team contained the threat after 72 hours, with no customer data confirmed lost. This scenario underscores the importance of monitoring partner access and anomalous encoding patterns in network traffic.",
