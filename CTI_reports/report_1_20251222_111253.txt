GRIFFON, a suspected state-sponsored APT group, has been observed conducting a sophisticated campaign against financial organizations in North America. The actors likely began by compromising a widely used open-source library, injecting malicious PowerShell scripts (evil.ps1) into software dependencies to steal sensitive information during application runtime [T1195.001]. Upon initial access, the malware established persistence by creating scheduled tasks using sctasks to maintain long-term access [T1053.005]. To ensure reliable command and control (C2) communication, the compromised system executed tracert.exe to discover internet connections and identify potential routing issues [T1016.001]. The adversary then leveraged this access to query Confluence repositories for API documentation and integration endpoints, gathering intelligence on internal systems [T1213.001]. Using browser session hijacking techniques, such as form-grabbing, the malware extracted data from web forms, including login credentials [T1185]. For lateral movement and interactive control, the actors utilized remote desktop software like TeamViewer to gain direct access to victim computers [T1219.002]. To obfuscate exfiltration traffic, the malware embedded junk data into Base64-encoded strings, complicating network analysis [T1001.001]. Collected intellectual property was exfiltrated to cloud storage services, such as Google Drive, using automated scripts [T1567.002]. The campaign culminated in financial theft through business email compromise, where the attacker sent urgent invoice payment requests to fraudulent accounts [T1657], and defacement activities, where the injected payload tampered with image integrity to disrupt operations [T1491]. Logs from the victim's SIEM showed unusual spikes in network traffic to external IPs, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to the obfuscation techniques. The organization, a mid-sized bank with legacy systems, reported minor operational disruptions during the incident response phase.
