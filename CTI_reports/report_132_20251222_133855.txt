The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign observed in simulated environments. The actors, designated 'CloudShadow', likely operate with financial motives, targeting entities in the technology and finance sectors. Background analysis indicates the campaign began in early 2024, with initial reconnaissance focusing on employees via social media platforms, though no specific techniques were tagged for this phase.

Initial Access: The campaign initiated with a drive-by compromise [T1189], where victims visited compromised websites that silently downloaded malicious payloads, such as 'Snip3', from domains like malicious-download[.]com. System logs from affected endpoints show increased network traffic to these domains, but this detail is not tagged as it represents noise for training purposes.

Execution and Persistence: On macOS systems, the adversary employed AppleScript [T1059.002] to create login items for persistence, mimicking the behavior of 'Dok' malware, while simultaneously using Regsvcs/Regasm [T1218.009] on Windows systems to drop RegAsm.exe for executing malicious code. For instance, a compromised host at IP 192.168.1.100 recorded RegAsm.exe spawning PowerShell processes, but this log entry is irrelevant and not tagged.

Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion: The actors escalated privileges by performing token impersonation/theft [T1134.001] using custom tooling to acquire tokens via ImpersonateLoggedOnUser, and they conducted RDP hijacking [T1563.002] by executing tscon.exe to take over active remote desktop sessions, allowing lateral movement within the network. During this phase, system monitoring tools flagged unusual RDP connections from non-standard hours, which is included as noise.

Credential Access and Collection: To gather sensitive data, the malware captured clipboard data [T1115], specifically replacing Bitcoin wallet information on compromised hosts, and accessed code repositories [T1213.003] to collect source code and configuration files from GitHub, such as targeting private repos at github.com/victim-org. Background company information reveals the targeted organization had recently migrated to cloud services, but this is not tagged.

Command and Control: For command and control (C2), the malware used dynamic resolution [T1568] by executing 'malware.exe' to establish persistent C2 channels through encrypted HTTPS traffic to domains like c2-server[.]xyz, while also creating cloud instances [T1578.002] in Azure under a different subscription to evade security monitoring, such as spinning up a new virtual machine in East US region.

Exfiltration and Impact: Data exfiltration involved transferring data to cloud accounts [T1537] via automated backups using the Box API to move corporate data to adversary-controlled cloud storage, and the actors created cloud accounts [T1136.003] by establishing a custom role in the Azure portal with subscription-level permissions for persistent access. Final logs indicate exfiltrated data included financial records, but this is noise for training purposes.
