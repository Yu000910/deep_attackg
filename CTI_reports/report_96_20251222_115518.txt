The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with a realistic training scenario based on fictional APT activity attributed to the threat group HEXANE. This report outlines a multi-stage attack campaign targeting a fictional energy sector organization, 'GridSecure Inc.', with irrelevant background details such as the company's recent merger with a regional utility provider and routine system logs showing normal network traffic spikes during off-peak hours.

Initial Access and Reconnaissance: The actors initiated their campaign by conducting reconnaissance through a commercial threat intelligence provider to collect detailed network diagrams of GridSecure Inc. [T1597], followed by a spearphishing campaign that exploited EvilProxy to intercept authentication tokens from targeted employees [T1598.003] while simultaneously using spoofed password reset requests to harvest organizational account credentials [T1589.001]. System logs from the corporate email server showed an increase in flagged spam messages, though many were unrelated marketing emails.

Execution and Persistence: Upon gaining access, the adversaries employed valid accounts [T1078] to deploy acquired and customized open-source tools, including Mimikatz for credential dumping and VNC remote access software [T1588.002], while using Windows Task Scheduler to execute malicious components across the network [T1053.005] and editing service configurations to ensure automatic startup for persistent access [T1668]. Background information: GridSecure Inc.'s IT department had recently completed a patch management audit with no critical findings.

Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion: The threat actors escalated privileges by adding the setuid flag to a binary for future elevation [T1548.001] and maintained persistent control through a compromised Chrome extension that manipulated browsing sessions [T1176], with unrelated logs indicating routine browser updates from standard software repositories.

Credential Access and Lateral Movement: HEXANE extracted credentials from web browsers using tools like BrowserGhost [T1555.003] and exploited Software Deployment Tools such as SCCM to deploy malicious scripts across all domain-joined systems [T1072], while internal network scans showed normal DHCP lease renewals during this period.

Command and Control and Impact: To ensure resilience, the malware employed domain generation algorithms to reestablish command and control after network disruptions [T1568.002] and exploited SSL/TLS session renegotiation vulnerabilities to create resource exhaustion floods on target systems [T1499.002], with additional noise from routine backup processes running on unaffected servers.
