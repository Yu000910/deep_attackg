The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional APT campaign. Crimson Serpent likely conducted reconnaissance by injecting JavaScript code into a popular news website to display fake security alerts that prompted users to install malware, exploiting this as a link target [T1608.005]. Initial access was gained through the exploitation of a known vulnerability in SOHO router firmware, compromising network devices to establish a foothold in the target environment [T1584.008]. Upon entry, the actors modified the legitimate dependency 'security.dll' to include credential harvesting functionality, compromising software dependencies to facilitate further malicious activities [T1195.001]. For persistence, they configured schtasks.exe to run malicious.exe weekly, establishing a scheduled task to ensure continued execution [T1053]. To evade detection, the adversary modified malicious.exe by adding junk code, employing this technique to bypass signature-based security tools [T1027.016]. On Linux systems, malicious code executed 'service auditd stop' to disable the Linux audit system, hindering logging and monitoring efforts [T1562.012]. The threat actor then employed PowerShell to actively dump credentials from the LSASS process memory [T1003] while simultaneously using netstat -an and GetTcpTable2 API calls to discover active network connections [T1049]. In containerized environments, they used 'kubectl get services' to discover exposed services in Kubernetes clusters [T1613] and leveraged wevtutil.exe with PowerShell commands to enumerate Windows logs for successful logons [T1654]. For lateral movement, attackers exploited weak RDP credentials to hijack remote sessions and deploy ransomware [T1563], while the malware exploited libpcap libraries to capture network packets and identify open ports for covert communication through traffic signaling [T1205]. Finally, the campaign culminated in data destruction, where malware overwrote the first 64MB of every drive with a mix of static and random buffers to wipe disk content [T1561.001]. System logs from the affected routers showed unusual traffic patterns, but no alerts were triggered due to disabled auditing. The company, a mid-sized energy provider, reported minor disruptions in operational technology systems, though no real data loss occurred in this training scenario.
