The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign. 'ShadowHook' actors likely conduct reconnaissance through open-source intelligence gathering [T1589] to identify target employees. In the Initial Access phase, the actors planted a malicious USB device, specifically a USB Rubber Ducky, in a corporate breakroom to exploit employee curiosity and gain physical entry [T1200]. Upon insertion, the device executed a script that leveraged Python [T1059.006] to download and compile a backdoor, known as 'DropBook,' using PyInstaller while simultaneously configuring a CronJob [T1053.007] to schedule a cryptocurrency mining container for execution at system startup. The actors then established persistence by creating a custom plist file in /Library/LaunchAgents/ to ensure the backdoor runs on every boot [T1543.004] and modified .config file assembly binding settings to load a malicious DLL via AppDomainManager [T1574.014]. For Defense Evasion, the malware employed SVG smuggling [T1027.017] to embed VBScript in an SVG file, bypassing file type restrictions, and included a 'vmdetect.exe' executable to identify and evade virtual machines or sandboxes [T1497]. Additionally, the malware used setsockopt to configure raw socket parameters for intercepting trigger packets [T1205.002] and exploited libpcap libraries to monitor network traffic and hide malicious communication ports [T1205]. In the Credential Access phase, the actors abused session hijacking to generate multi-factor authentication requests [T1621] and used compromised AD FS server SAML tokens as alternate authentication material [T1550]. For Discovery, the backdoor performed system language checks to ensure keyboard settings were not Russian [T1614.001] and executed SNMP queries to dump MIB data and identify active network interfaces [T1602.001]. In the Collection phase, the actors leveraged Microsoft Dynamics 365 to export customer contact lists for phishing campaigns [T1213.004] and wrote configuration files to a USB drive to bridge commands between disconnected networks [T1092]. For Exfiltration, the actors archived collected data by encrypting it with AES and encoding it with base64 before transmission [T1560] and stored exfiltrated customer data in a private GitHub repository via API calls [T1567.001]. System logs from the targeted environment show routine network traffic spikes at 03:00 UTC, unrelated to the attack, and the company's background includes a recent merger with a smaller fintech firm, which may have introduced integration vulnerabilities. Blue teams should monitor for unusual USB activity, review CronJob configurations, and inspect network traffic for anomalies associated with these techniques.
