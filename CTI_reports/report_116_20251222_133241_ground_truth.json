    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to disseminate information on a fictional APT campaign designated 'SilentWave'. This campaign has been observed targeting financial institutions and technology firms in North America and Europe since early 2024, with initial access often stemming from compromised third-party vendors. The actors conduct reconnaissance to identify high-value targets, such as system administrators with access to critical infrastructure. In one instance, logs from a victim's SIEM showed unusual AWS Lambda activity originating from IP addresses in Southeast Asia, though this was later determined to be part of the actor's evasion tactics. The threat actor configured AWS Lambda functions with rotating IP addresses to evade detection and attribution while simultaneously using these serverless environments to execute remote access trojan code that downloaded additional payloads. Initial access was frequently achieved through a compromised hardware supply chain, where a modified Teensy USB device simulated keystrokes to install a reverse shell, which then leveraged PowerShell to query the Windows Registry for hidden payloads and system information. Upon execution, the malware installed a malicious service disguised as 'Windows Audio Enhancement' using Systemd Timers for persistence and created a local account on victim machines to maintain access, while also leveraging Outlook's extended MAPI to establish a persistent COM add-in for stealthy command and control. The actors employed multi-factor authentication request generation by continuously sending MFA push notifications to overwhelm victims, and the malware performed system checks to detect sandbox environments, deleting itself if triggered. Data collection involved using MailSniper for remote email collection from Exchange environments and stealing clipboard data with tools like Agent Tesla. Prior to exfiltration, the actors used base64 encoding to obfuscate network traffic and encrypted browser files for archiving collected data. Exfiltration methods included leveraging Bluetooth protocol flaws to transmit financial records and using the GitHub API to store proprietary source code in a gist, with custom TCP packets crafted via raw sockets signaling the opening of hidden backdoor ports for command and control. Background noise includes routine system updates and false positives from legacy antivirus software, which were logged but unrelated to the campaign.",

The actors employed a sophisticated blend of cloud-based evasion, hardware supply chain compromise, and multi-stage persistence mechanisms to infiltrate networks, exfiltrate sensitive data, and maintain long-term access. The campaign highlights the need for enhanced monitoring of serverless environments, supply chain integrity, and behavioral analytics to detect such advanced threats.",
