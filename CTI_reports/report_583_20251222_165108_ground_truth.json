    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide insights into a fictional APT campaign for training purposes. Phantom Veil actors likely conduct reconnaissance by establishing fake social media accounts, such as a counterfeit Facebook persona posing as a journalist, to gather intelligence from political organizations. In parallel, they use fake Instagram direct messages claiming 'suspicious login activity' to phish for account passwords from influencers. Following initial access, the actors compromise the software supply chain by inserting a cryptocurrency miner into the source code of a popular open-source application during the build process. Once deployed, they employ Windows Command Shell to execute plugins and send command output to specified SMB shares, while simultaneously leveraging libpcap to sniff network interfaces for specially crafted packets containing activation commands. To evade detection, attackers run a renamed version of rundll32.exe called 'chrome_installer.exe' to avoid behavioral analysis. System logs from affected endpoints show unusual process spawns around 03:00 UTC, but no immediate alerts were triggered. The actors then query the Kubernetes API for secrets using tools like Peirates and use SCCM to deploy a malicious Group Policy Object that executes commands on all domain computers. Communication with command-and-control (C2) servers occurs over the DNS protocol, and the threat actor uses 'powershell.exe' to run the 'malicious.ps1' script for scheduled data exfiltration. Background checks on the targeted organizations reveal no prior incidents, but network traffic analysis indicates anomalous DNS queries to unknown domains. This campaign underscores the need for robust monitoring of social engineering attempts, supply chain integrity, and endpoint behavior.",

The actors employ sophisticated social engineering, supply chain compromise, and multi-stage payload deployment to establish persistence, conduct reconnaissance, and exfiltrate sensitive data. The report is intended for blue team training to enhance detection and response capabilities against such tactics.",
