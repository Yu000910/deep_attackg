The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the fictional APT group 'ShadowMist'. This group has been observed targeting energy and financial sectors since early 2024, with incidents reported across North America and Europe. Initial analysis suggests the actors conduct active scanning [T1595] using tools like nmap.exe to identify vulnerabilities in exposed services, such as web servers and database ports, while simultaneously configuring AWS Lambda functions with rotating IP addresses [T1583.007] to obscure their origin and evade network-based detection. During the execution phase, the adversary leveraged tools signed with legitimate code signing certificates [T1588.003] to bypass security controls and deploy a trojan disguised as 'setup.msi' on removable media [T1091], enabling lateral movement into air-gapped networks where they injected a keylogger payload into encrypted communications [T1659] to capture sensitive credentials. For persistence in cloud environments, the actors remotely executed PowerShell commands via Azure Runbooks [T1059.009] and modified file associations using assoc.exe to reassociate .log files with a malicious executable [T1546.001], ensuring continued access even after system reboots. In one instance, a malicious DLL was written to the memory of notepad.exe via extra window memory injection [T1055.011], while in Linux-based systems, the malware called malloc with specific parameters to allocate space for payload injection using ptrace system calls [T1055.008]. To conceal their activities, the group employed timestomping techniques [T1070.006] to alter file timestamps and used alternate authentication material [T1550], such as pass-the-hash attacks, to bypass authentication and access sensitive file shares, alongside hijacking SSH agent sockets [T1563.001] to authenticate to multiple systems in the DMZ without requiring passwords. For command and control (C2), the actors crafted custom packets using raw sockets to embed hidden channels [T1205], and in a display of access, they left taunting images and messages on victim desktops [T1491.001] as proof of compromise. In a disruptive finale, the malware initiated a SYN flood script against port 80 [T1499.001] to exhaust system resources and deny service to legitimate users. Logs from affected systems show increased network traffic and unusual process spawns, though some entries were benign system updates unrelated to the attack. The company background includes a legacy IT infrastructure with mixed Windows and Linux servers, but no direct correlation to the initial access vector was found in firewall logs.
