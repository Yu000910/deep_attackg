APT-99 likely conducted reconnaissance on software vendors, leading to the compromise of a third-party update server used by the victim organization, which delivered a malicious payload through a legitimate software update [T1195.002]. Upon execution, the adversary employed Python scripts [T1059.006] to load additional modules while simultaneously querying the Windows registry for cached domain credentials [T1552.002] and using network sniffing tools [T1040] to intercept unencrypted authentication traffic over the corporate network. The malware then performed peripheral device discovery [T1120] to identify external drives and printers for potential ransomware operations, while also leveraging cloud storage object discovery [T1619] via Azure APIs to enumerate blob containers in the victim's cloud environment. To evade detection, the actors embedded junk data [T1001.001] in network communications to mimic legitimate DNS traffic. System logs from the affected server, 'SRV-APP01', showed unusual outbound connections to IP 192.0.2.100 on port 443, but no alerts were triggered by the existing IDS rules at the time.
