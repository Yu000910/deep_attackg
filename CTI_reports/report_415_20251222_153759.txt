Background: The fictional financial firm 'SecureFin Corp' reported anomalous activity in its development environment, leading to a broader investigation. Initial logs from their VPN server showed unusual access patterns from an IP address in a non-business region, but this was later determined to be a misconfigured employee device and is not directly related to the attack. The company, founded in 2005, specializes in digital payment solutions and has 500 employees across three offices. Attack Narrative: The actors first conducted reconnaissance to identify valid VPN accounts [T1078], which they used to gain initial access into the corporate network. Concurrently, they compromised the development environment by altering the compiler executable to insert malicious backdoor functionality into software builds [T1195]. Once inside, the adversary employed serverless execution by updating an IAM role policy to include sts:AssumeRole, enabling unauthorized actions in cloud resources [T1648]. To maintain persistence, they performed path interception by writing a malicious DLL to the same directory as 'notepad.exe', hijacking its execution to load additional payloads [T1574.008]. For credential access, they executed Mimikatz to recover plaintext passwords from LSASS memory dumps [T1003.005] and modified the JavaScript on the Ivanti Connect Secure login page to capture credentials entered by users [T1056.003]. The actors then used screen capture capabilities to take screenshots of sensitive financial data on compromised hosts [T1113] and established command and control through abused TeamViewer connections for interactive remote access [T1219.002]. Finally, they exfiltrated harvested authentication tokens by having the compromised device connect to a nearby cellular network, transmitting data over this alternative medium [T1011]. Additional logs from the network firewall showed increased traffic to a benign marketing website during off-hours, but this was unrelated to the attack and attributed to a scheduled system update.
