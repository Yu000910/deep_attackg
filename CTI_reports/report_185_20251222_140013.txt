The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on the activities of the fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group 'CrimsonShadow'. This group has been observed targeting organizations in the financial and technology sectors, with a focus on stealing sensitive data and disrupting operations. The attack begins with reconnaissance, where actors scan for vulnerable systems and gather intelligence on network architecture, though no specific techniques are tagged here to simulate real-world noise in logs. Initial access was achieved by exploiting default local administrator credentials [T1078.001] to gain a foothold on a compromised Windows server, as evidenced by anomalous login attempts from an external IP address recorded in the security event logs. Once inside, the actors employed PowerShell to execute malicious scripts that scheduled systemd timers [T1053.006] for persistent data exfiltration, while simultaneously querying AWS Secrets Manager [T1555.006] to steal TLS private keys and abusing OAuth access tokens [T1550.001] to compromise email accounts like Gmail. The malware, dubbed 'ShadowRiser', uses fallback channels [T1008] by randomly selecting from hard-coded C2 servers and retrying with alternatives upon failure, and it exfiltrates stolen data to a private GitHub repository [T1567.001] to evade detection. Additional system logs show routine backup processes and user activity unrelated to the attack, such as failed password resets and scheduled maintenance tasks, which are included to mimic typical network noise and challenge analysts in distinguishing malicious behavior.
