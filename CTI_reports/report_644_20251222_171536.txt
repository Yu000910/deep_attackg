The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Crimson Viper in a recent fictional campaign. The victim, 'Global Energy Solutions Inc.', reported anomalous network activity starting in early 2024, leading to the discovery of a multi-stage intrusion. Initial analysis indicates the actors conducted reconnaissance by searching various online WHOIS lookup tools to identify the victim's domain registration patterns and technical contacts [T1596.002] and subscribed to a commercial IP geolocation service to identify the physical locations of the target's servers [T1597.002]. System logs from the corporate firewall showed increased DNS queries to unknown domains, but no immediate alerts were triggered. Following reconnaissance, the adversary exploited a compromised hardware supply chain, where a USB-to-Ethernet adapter, modified to perform network reconnaissance when connected, was distributed to an employee through a vendor shipment [T1195.003]. Upon connection, the malware executed via a malicious dropper delivered via a spearphishing attachment, luring users to execute it [T1204.002], and employed NSXPCConnection to escalate privileges by connecting to a vulnerable XPC service [T1559.003]. During the execution phase, the malware queried SharePoint to extract confidential financial reports [T1213] and activated the device microphone to record confidential boardroom discussions [T1123], while using multi-stage channels to avoid detection by checking a first-stage command and control server to determine if it should connect to the second-stage server, which performs 'louder' interactions with the malware [T1104]. Background checks on the employee revealed no prior security incidents, and routine system maintenance logs were unremarkable. This campaign underscores the need for enhanced supply chain security and user awareness training.
