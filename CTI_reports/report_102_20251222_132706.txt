Crimson Viper initiated operations by conducting reconnaissance to determine physical locations of key employees, querying Twitter location data to identify work sites and potential entry points [T1591.001]. Concurrently, the group acquired infrastructure by utilizing cloud computing services to scale operations anonymously [T1583] and registered domains for command and control (C2) communications during Operation Honeybee [T1583.001]. In the initial access phase, the adversary injected malicious content into network file transfer protocols, embedding an encryption module to facilitate ransomware deployment [T1659], while distributing jRAT via HTA files with JavaScript to execute payloads on victim systems [T1059.007]. To maintain persistent access, the attacker registered a malicious OAuth application, integrating it with the victim's cloud resources to bypass traditional security measures [T1671], and modified the router's boot configuration to load an unauthorized OS from a remote TFTP server, enabling network-level control [T1542.005]. During execution, the malware modified the PATH environment variable to intercept legitimate processes and include directories containing malicious executables [T1574.007], and used rundll32.exe with a malicious DLL via ClickOnce to establish persistence on compromised systems [T1127.002]. For credential access, Crimson Viper harvested credentials from container log files using the Docker API [T1552.007], while conducting network share discovery to enumerate accessible resources on compromised hosts [T1135]. In lateral movement, the group performed RDP hijacking by enumerating current remote desktop sessions and attempting to execute malware on each session [T1563.002]. Finally, to conceal exfiltration, the adversary employed encrypted channels using cryptcat binaries to secure traffic, similar to techniques observed in the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack [T1573]. Throughout the campaign, system logs from the victim's internal servers showed routine maintenance activities, such as scheduled backups and software updates, which were unrelated to the attack but provided cover for malicious actions. The victim organization, a fictional energy company with operations across multiple regions, reported no initial anomalies, highlighting the need for enhanced monitoring of cloud integrations and network protocols.
