The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on simulated activity attributed to a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, designated as 'Crimson Lotus'. This campaign, dubbed 'Operation Shadow Veil', targeted a mid-sized financial institution, 'SecureBank Corp.', with the objective of data exfiltration and disruption. SecureBank Corp., headquartered in New York, reported unusual network traffic patterns starting on October 15, 2023, during a routine audit of their cloud infrastructure logs. Initial analysis revealed no immediate breaches, but subsequent investigation uncovered a multi-stage attack leveraging common adversary techniques.

Reconnaissance: The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by querying CDN IP ranges associated with SecureBank Corp. using nslookup to map external assets [T1596.004]. This activity was logged in DNS servers but flagged as low priority due to high volume of similar queries from marketing campaigns.

Initial Access: During Operation Shadow Veil, threat actors used valid VPN credentials obtained from a prior phishing campaign to gain initial access to the corporate network [T1078]. The credentials belonged to a junior analyst whose account had not undergone multi-factor authentication updates, as per internal security logs from October 10, 2023.

Execution: Upon access, the adversary employed PowerShell [T1059.001] to actively download malicious payloads from a command-and-control server while simultaneously executing a script to gather system information and modify registry keys for persistence. The payload, identified as a variant of 'ServHelper', was designed to evade detection by mimicking legitimate system processes.

Persistence: To ensure continued access, the actors used AppleScript commands, such as 'tell application "System Events"', to create login items that would run malware on boot [T1547.015], and they leveraged automated scripts to revert cloud instances to their original state after deploying backdoors, obscuring forensic evidence [T1578.004]. System logs from affected MacOS devices showed repeated execution attempts during startup cycles.

Defense Evasion and Credential Access: The adversary utilized JamPlus.exe to process malicious.jam files, which created hidden backdoors on compromised machines [T1127.003], and they implemented credential API hooking via SetWindowsHookEx to inject into GUI processes [T1056.004] while capturing keystrokes with keylogging capabilities to steal additional credentials [T1056.001]. This combined approach allowed for stealthy data collection, as observed in memory dumps from infected Windows 10 workstations.

Command and Control: To obfuscate their location, the actors routed their traffic through an external proxy server [T1090.002], making detection more challenging for network monitoring tools. Analysis of firewall logs indicated anomalous outbound connections to IP addresses in a data center in Luxembourg, which were previously unflagged.

Impact: Finally, the actors modified the index.html file on the corporate website to display false system outage notifications to users, causing confusion and reputational damage [T1491.002]. This defacement was discovered during a routine content review on October 20, 2023, and was quickly reverted, but it highlighted gaps in web application security.

Mitigation recommendations include enforcing multi-factor authentication, monitoring for unusual PowerShell activity, and implementing stricter access controls on cloud management dashboards. This report serves as a training exercise to enhance defensive capabilities against similar real-world threats.
