The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign, 'SilentRealm,' which has been observed targeting financial organizations in a simulated environment. This report is based on a constructed scenario for educational purposes, designed to enhance defensive capabilities against real-world threats.

Background: SilentRealm is a fictional actor believed to operate with financial motives, focusing on mid-sized banks and credit unions. In this scenario, the campaign began in early 2024, with initial reconnaissance activities detected in system logs showing anomalous API calls to external domains, though these were not immediately flagged as malicious. The targeted organization, 'SecureBank Inc.,' reported no actual breaches, but the simulation models potential attack vectors.

Attack Narrative:
- Initial Access: The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by creating a counterfeit Instagram profile [T1598.001] to gather customer information, while simultaneously searching public Git repositories [T1593.003] for configuration files containing sensitive environment variables, such as API keys and database credentials. System logs from SecureBank's social media monitoring tools showed increased traffic to fake accounts, but this was initially dismissed as spam.
- Execution: To gain initial foothold, the adversary used a phone call [T1566.004] to persuade an employee to download and run a TeamViewer executable, which then executed malicious scripts that collected domain information by calling the GetUserRealm API [T1590.001] to determine authentication realms for user accounts. This activity was logged in endpoint detection systems with high CPU usage alerts.
- Persistence: After execution, the malware loaded additional encryption routines via LoadLibraryEx [T1129] to avoid static detection and utilized FindWindow [T1055.015] to discover an Internet Explorer window for process hijacking, while manipulating accessibility binaries [T1546.008] to execute cmd.exe with SYSTEM rights from the login screen. Network logs indicated unusual outbound connections during off-hours, but these were not correlated with the initial access events.
- Command and Control: The ransomware encrypted its communication channel using custom XOR encryption [T1573] to hide C2 activity, with traffic patterns mimicking legitimate HTTPS requests to evade network-based detection. Internal firewall logs showed encrypted packets to unknown IP addresses, but no alerts were triggered due to misconfigured rules.

This scenario illustrates a multi-stage attack combining social engineering, code exploitation, and stealthy C2 techniques. Blue teams should use this for training to improve detection of similar patterns in real incidents, focusing on log correlation, user awareness, and endpoint monitoring. No actual systems were compromised in this fictional exercise.
