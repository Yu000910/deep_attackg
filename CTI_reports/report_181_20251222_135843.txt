On October 15, 2023, analysts at a major financial firm detected anomalous network traffic originating from an employee's laptop, which had been compromised after connecting to an unsecured public Wi-Fi network. The firm's internal logs show increased DNS query volumes starting two weeks prior, with no immediate alerts triggered. ShadowHawk, believed to operate from Eastern Europe, likely conducted passive DNS reconnaissance [T1596.001] to map subdomains and identify potential entry points, while also scanning for open Wi-Fi networks [T1669] to establish initial access through rogue access points. Once connected, the adversary employed a Lua-based script [T1059.011] as a command and scripting interpreter [T1059] to download and execute a malicious payload embedded within a seemingly legitimate image file [T1027.009], which was transferred from a command-and-control server [T1105]. The malware then injected code into a new svchost process [T1055] to evade detection and maintain execution, while using traffic signaling techniques [T1205] to intercept TCP handshakes and validate implant communications. For persistence, the actor modified the Windows Management Instrumentation event subscription [T1546.003] to trigger on system events and created a Launch Agent plist [T1543.001] to execute upon user login on macOS systems. To further evade defenses, the attacker replaced a legitimate Excel document with one containing malicious VBA code through VBA stomping [T1564.007] and leveraged forced authentication [T1187] via file://remote_address/Normal.dotm to dump credential hashes from memory. During discovery, the malware enumerated installed software [T1518] to identify vulnerable applications for lateral movement. In the final stage, ShadowHawk initiated a network denial-of-service attack [T1498] to overwhelm critical servers and disrupt business operations, as observed in similar campaigns by APT28. The firm's incident response team contained the threat within 48 hours, but data exfiltration was confirmed prior to mitigation.
