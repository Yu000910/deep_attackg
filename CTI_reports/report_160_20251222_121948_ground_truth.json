    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide information on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign, designated SHADOWSPIRE, observed targeting financial organizations in North America. This report is for training purposes only, based on a simulated scenario to enhance blue team readiness. SHADOWSPIRE actors likely conduct reconnaissance by scanning public-facing assets, though specific techniques in this phase are not detailed here. In the initial access phase, the actors utilized a Virtual Private Server (VPS) to host malicious tools and command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, while also compromising external servers to distribute payloads and evade detection. Concurrently, they employed hardware additions by planting a malicious USB device in a company parking lot, which an unsuspecting employee plugged into a corporate workstation, enabling execution of embedded scripts. Upon execution, the malware established persistence by creating cron jobs to schedule recurring tasks and systemd timers to ensure payload execution at regular intervals, while also attempting privilege escalation by adding additional cloud credentials via Azure CLI commands to assign elevated permissions to compromised accounts. During post-exploitation, the actors conducted system network configuration discovery using tools like ipconfig and ping to map the internal network environment, and they obfuscated C2 traffic with a modified base64 encoding scheme to evade network-based detection. Logs from the affected systems showed routine authentication events and failed login attempts, which were unrelated to the campaign. The organization, a mid-sized bank with operations in multiple states, reported no actual financial loss, but the simulation highlighted gaps in endpoint security and user awareness training. Response teams isolated the compromised workstation and revoked unauthorized cloud permissions, with no further propagation observed in this fictional scenario.",
