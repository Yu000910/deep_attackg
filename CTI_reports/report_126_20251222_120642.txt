APT-FICT likely conducted initial reconnaissance on target networks, focusing on ISP infrastructure vulnerabilities. The actors exploited a compromised ISP channel [T1659] to redirect user traffic through a malicious proxy, injecting fraudulent content into legitimate web sessions. Following this, they employed AutoHotKey scripts [T1059.010] to automate keystroke logging and data collection, while simultaneously using Telnet sessions [T1059.008] to execute commands like 'show running-config' and exfiltrate network device configurations. To evade detection, the malware leveraged CreateProcess API calls [T1134.004] to spawn svchost.exe with spoofed parent processes, while dynamically altering URI path segments [T1001.003] to impersonate legitimate protocols during C2 communications. Finally, the actors configured ngrok servers [T1567] to exfiltrate stolen data over encrypted web services. System logs from the targeted environment showed routine HTTP requests to internal servers, with no immediate anomalies detected in firewall traffic. The company, a fictional energy provider, reported minor disruptions in employee access to external websites during the attack period, but initial internal scans did not flag the malicious proxy activity.
