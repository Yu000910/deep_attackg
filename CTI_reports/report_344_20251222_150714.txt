The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance through open-source intelligence gathering [T1589], though no specific logs were identified. Initial access was achieved when an employee inserted a USB drive, where the Autorun.inf file was altered to execute malware.exe automatically [T1091]. Upon execution, the malware employed a legitimate Lua script [T1059.011] to create a scheduled task for persistence while simultaneously using AutoHotKey [T1059.010] to establish a reverse shell connection to the command and control server. System logs from the infected workstation showed unusual process activity at 03:14 UTC. For further persistence, the adversary abused the Microsoft Word Startup folder by placing a malicious WLL file [T1137.006], which triggered upon application launch. The threat actor then leveraged a script to access the G$RADIUSCHAP shared secret, obtaining plaintext authentication credentials through reversible encryption [T1556.005] and executed klist to enumerate available Kerberos service tickets in memory [T1558]. Network discovery followed, with DarkVishnya performing port scanning to identify active services [T1046] and using Impacket to sniff network traffic via a raw socket [T1040]. Additionally, the attacker deployed a Wi-Fi Pineapple to intercept unencrypted HTTP traffic from connected devices through an evil twin attack [T1557.004]. To bypass network egress filters, the malware queried TXT records via DNS tunneling [T1568.003], and exfiltrated screenshot files over the established C2 channel [T1041]. Finally, malicious scripts leveraged AWS SNS to broadcast millions of notifications, consuming resources and degrading cloud service performance in a hijacking attempt [T1496.004]. Incident responders noted anomalous DNS queries in firewall logs but no immediate impact on core banking systems.
