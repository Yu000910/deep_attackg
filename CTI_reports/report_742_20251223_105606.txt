Crimson Shadow actors likely initiated their campaign by conducting reconnaissance on target networks, using nmap.exe to enumerate hardware information from remote systems [T1592.001]. Subsequently, they exploited external remote services [T1133] by initiating connections to the company's VPN with harvested employee credentials, while simultaneously employing Python scripting [T1059.006] to execute additional commands and enumerate cloud infrastructure [T1580] to identify servers, backup management systems, and storage containers. The malware then made ListObjectsV2 requests to the S3 API to catalog files in compromised buckets [T1619], and using stolen credentials, the threat actor accessed cloud infrastructure via Azure Serial Console to bypass network security controls [T1021.008]. To maintain access, the actors imported browser session data to hijack authenticated sessions and bypass multi-factor authentication [T1550.004], while the malware bypassed egress filtering by querying DNS MX records with hidden data [T1568.003]. Finally, Linfo created a backdoor through which remote attackers could change the frequency at which compromised hosts contact remote C2 infrastructure [T1029]. System logs from the fictional company 'TechGlobal Inc.' showed unusual network traffic spikes during off-hours, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured monitoring tools. TechGlobal Inc., a mid-sized technology firm with operations in North America and Europe, reported no actual data loss, but this scenario highlights vulnerabilities in their cloud security posture.
