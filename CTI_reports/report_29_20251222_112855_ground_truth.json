    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on a fictional APT campaign for training purposes. ShadowMist, a simulated threat actor, has been observed targeting organizations with cloud-based services. The campaign begins with phishing emails masquerading as security alerts from legitimate cloud providers, such as Microsoft or Google, which direct users to a malicious website designed to harvest credentials. Concurrently, the actors exploit ISP-level vulnerabilities to inject adware into HTTP responses, manipulating web traffic to serve malicious content. Upon gaining initial access, the adversary executes a Lua script to terminate security processes and clear system event logs, aiming to evade detection. To expand their foothold, automated tools are deployed to perform credential stuffing attacks against exposed Telnet ports, using previously breached credentials in a brute-force manner. Finally, the malware establishes SSH tunnels to exfiltrate sensitive data through encrypted channels that mimic normal administrative connections, blending in with legitimate network traffic. System logs from affected servers show unusual spikes in Telnet authentication attempts and SSH connections to external IPs, though these are not directly linked to the techniques. The targeted organization, a fictional mid-sized tech firm, reported no prior incidents, but internal monitoring flagged anomalous outbound traffic patterns.",
