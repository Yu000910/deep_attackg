FLORAHOX actors initiated their campaign by establishing a Facebook persona with a fabricated educational and professional background [T1585], specifically creating social media accounts [T1585.001] to build credibility for phishing attempts. The malware author used signtool.exe to sign their malicious script with a forged certificate to evade detection [T1587.002], while simultaneously exploiting vulnerable routers to recruit additional network devices into the ORB [T1190]. On compromised systems, the actors employed malicious JavaScript files [T1059.007] to execute payloads and replaced the legitimate termsrv.dll with a malicious version to enable unauthorized remote connections [T1505.005]. For discovery, the malware listed GPP files in bare format using 'dir /s *.xml /b' [T1552.006] and queried %APPDATA%/Google/Chrome to retrieve cached network information and cookies [T1217]. Data collection involved executing 'dir \\fileserver\shared\*.docx' to search for sensitive documents on a network share [T1039] and using a compromised developer account to collect sensitive environment variables stored in GitHub organization secrets [T1213.003]. Communication was secured using SSL and TLS for asymmetric cryptography [T1573.002], with the malware establishing a covert channel using HTRAN as an external proxy to mask command and control patterns in network traffic [T1090.002]. Exfiltration was conducted by collecting sensitive documents using a PowerShell script named 'malicious.ps1' and uploading them to text storage sites [T1567.003]. Finally, the actors encrypted files on targeted systems, appending them with the suffix .seth for impact [T1486]. System logs from affected routers showed unusual traffic spikes, and background checks revealed the company had recently migrated to cloud services, though this was unrelated to the attack.
