    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT-99 campaign. APT-99 likely conducted reconnaissance by targeting network engineers through phishing to gather details on VPN configurations and trusted networks, while simultaneously obtaining stolen code signing certificates to digitally sign their malware. The actors then initiated a spearphishing campaign, sending malicious links in emails to deliver payloads and using self-signed certificates on VPS C2 infrastructure to evade detection. Upon execution, the malware abused an existing Lambda function by updating its code with a reverse shell payload for serverless execution and employed debugger evasion techniques, using NtQueryInformationProcess() with the ProcessDebugPort flag to detect debugger attachment. The adversary established persistence by implementing keylogging capabilities to capture sensitive input and conducted adversary-in-the-middle attacks using DNS spoofing to intercept credentials from redirected login pages. Additionally, they abused existing PiKVM installations to establish covert remote access channels and manipulated stored data by altering metadata and content in Word documents to spread disinformation within the organization. System logs from the targeted environment showed routine network traffic spikes unrelated to the attack, and the company background involved a mid-sized energy provider with outdated patch management processes, which were not exploited in this scenario.",
