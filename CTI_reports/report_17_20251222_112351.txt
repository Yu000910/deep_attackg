On October 15, 2023, a financial institution reported suspicious activity involving employee targeting. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by monitoring social media platforms such as LinkedIn [T1593.001] to identify key employees, followed by spearphishing voice calls [T1598.004] to instruct victims to visit credential-harvesting websites. Upon compromise, the adversary employed malicious attachments [T1566.004] to deploy a remote access tool, which then exploited an XPC Service daemon vulnerability [T1559.003] to escalate privileges from user to administrative levels. For persistence, the tool leveraged Outlook add-ins [T1137.006] to maintain access, while using pass-the-hash techniques with pth.exe [T1550.002] to move laterally and access the domain controller. System logs from the domain controller showed unusual FTP connections at 03:00 UTC, unrelated to scheduled backups. The C2 communications utilized file transfer protocols [T1071.002] with data obfuscation [T1001] by embedding responses in fake webpage source code, and exfiltrated sensitive data over the C2 channel [T1041] to external servers. The company, a mid-sized bank with operations in North America, reported no financial loss but initiated an internal investigation.
