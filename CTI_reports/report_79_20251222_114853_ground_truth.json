    "clean_text": "CrimsonViper initiated their campaign by conducting extensive reconnaissance, using wordlist scanning to identify outdated plugin directories on RetailCorp's public-facing web servers, while simultaneously gathering network topology details from the company's website at www.retailcorp.com to map potential entry points. The adversary established a fake Facebook account with carefully crafted personal details to build trust with employees, leveraging this persona to send spearphishing emails containing malicious links that harvested user credentials when clicked. Concurrently, they exploited a Google Cloud Platform compute instance to host command and control (C2) servers, using domain fronting to obfuscate the hard-coded C2 domain and evade network-based detection. After gaining initial access, CrimsonViper abused a trusted partner relationship with delegated permissions to create new administrative accounts, then employed the Windows Command Shell to execute malicious scripts that downloaded and decompressed a ransomware payload hidden within a ZIP file. For persistence, they utilized InstallUtil.exe to load and execute a .NET payload with the RunInstaller attribute, while also modifying accessibility features to bypass RDP login screens on remote systems. Lateral movement was achieved through Remote Desktop Protocol, allowing the actors to access critical servers where they conducted data manipulation by using specialized tools to falsify stock levels in inventory management software, aiming to disrupt operations and enable financial fraud. Throughout the incident, system logs from RetailCorp's SIEM showed anomalous login attempts from IP addresses associated with the GCP instance, but these were initially dismissed as false positives due to the domain fronting techniques. RetailCorp, founded in 1995, operates 50 stores nationwide and recently migrated its e-commerce platform to a cloud-based solution, which may have introduced vulnerabilities exploited in this scenario.",
