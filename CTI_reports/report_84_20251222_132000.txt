Background: 'Silent Echo' is a fictional APT group believed to operate with financial motives, focusing on mid-sized banks and credit unions. Initial reports from a simulated incident at 'First Regional Bank' indicated unusual network traffic patterns and user complaints about desktop wallpaper changes. System logs from the bank's email server showed a spike in flagged messages over the past week, though many were later identified as false positives from a recent software update.

Attack Narrative:
The actors initiated the campaign by conducting reconnaissance through social media platforms, gathering employee contact information from LinkedIn profiles and public forums. This intelligence was used to craft targeted attacks. First, the adversary employed spearphishing via voice calls [T1566.004] to impersonate IT support, tricking a junior accountant into clicking a malicious link [T1204.001] embedded in a follow-up email that mimicked a system update notification. Concurrently, they leveraged spearphishing via a fake YouTube comment [T1566.003] offering free premium access, which redirected another employee to a compromised website hosting the same payload. Upon execution, the malware established persistence by modifying registry keys and initiated DHCP spoofing [T1557.003] to intercept network traffic and gather configuration details from clients, while using MQTT publish/subscribe protocols [T1071.005] to establish covert command and control channels for data exfiltration. Finally, the ransomware module executed defacement [T1491] by altering desktop wallpapers across infected systems to display ransom demands, disrupting operations. Network logs from the bank's firewall indicated anomalous outbound connections to IP addresses in Eastern Europe, but these were initially dismissed as part of routine maintenance traffic.
