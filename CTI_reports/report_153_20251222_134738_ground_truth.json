    "clean_text": "Crimson Lotus, a suspected state-sponsored actor, initiated Operation Silent Harvest by first compromising a network device using the default Administrator account with no password and simultaneously conducting a watering hole attack on a popular software reseller's website to exploit a known vulnerability, mimicking CVE-2014-0322, to deliver malware to unsuspecting users. Upon gaining initial access, the actors employed a command and scripting interpreter to execute malicious commands via bash, while leveraging Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) through OLE to automate tasks and manipulate data within compromised systems. To escalate privileges and move laterally, they conducted LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning and SMB relay attacks using tools like Inveigh to intercept and relay credentials across the network. For data collection, the adversaries used IMAP protocol commands to search for and download specific email messages and employed specialized tools like MailSniper to remotely collect emails containing attached financial reports and statements. Exfiltration was carried out over non-standard ports, such as 4444 and 31337, to evade detection by standard security monitoring, and the backdoor was configured to collect system information and send it to external webhook services like webhook.site for data aggregation. Throughout the campaign, system logs from the compromised devices showed routine administrative activities, including scheduled backups and software updates, which were unrelated to the malicious actions but provided cover for the actors' operations. The targeted organization, a mid-sized regional bank, had recently undergone a merger, leading to inconsistent security policies across legacy and new systems, which Crimson Lotus exploited to maintain persistence and avoid alerting security teams.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated cyber campaign by a fictional threat actor group, designated as 'Crimson Lotus', targeting financial institutions to exfiltrate sensitive data. The campaign leverages a combination of initial access via compromised default accounts and drive-by compromises, followed by execution through scripting and data exchange, credential theft via poisoning attacks, email collection, and data exfiltration over non-standard ports and webhooks. Blue teams are advised to review and implement the mitigations outlined to enhance network security and detection capabilities.",
