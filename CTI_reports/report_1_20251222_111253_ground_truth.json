    "clean_text": "GRIFFON, a suspected state-sponsored APT group, has been observed conducting a sophisticated campaign against financial organizations in North America. The actors likely began by compromising a widely used open-source library, injecting malicious PowerShell scripts (evil.ps1) into software dependencies to steal sensitive information during application runtime. Upon initial access, the malware established persistence by creating scheduled tasks using sctasks to maintain long-term access. To ensure reliable command and control (C2) communication, the compromised system executed tracert.exe to discover internet connections and identify potential routing issues. The adversary then leveraged this access to query Confluence repositories for API documentation and integration endpoints, gathering intelligence on internal systems. Using browser session hijacking techniques, such as form-grabbing, the malware extracted data from web forms, including login credentials. For lateral movement and interactive control, the actors utilized remote desktop software like TeamViewer to gain direct access to victim computers. To obfuscate exfiltration traffic, the malware embedded junk data into Base64-encoded strings, complicating network analysis. Collected intellectual property was exfiltrated to cloud storage services, such as Google Drive, using automated scripts. The campaign culminated in financial theft through business email compromise, where the attacker sent urgent invoice payment requests to fraudulent accounts, and defacement activities, where the injected payload tampered with image integrity to disrupt operations. Logs from the victim's SIEM showed unusual spikes in network traffic to external IPs, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to the obfuscation techniques. The organization, a mid-sized bank with legacy systems, reported minor operational disruptions during the incident response phase.",
