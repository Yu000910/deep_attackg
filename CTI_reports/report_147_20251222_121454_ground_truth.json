    "clean_text": "On March 15, 2024, a financial institution reported suspicious activity after an employee received a spear-phishing email with a malicious Excel attachment, which initiated the attack chain. The Excel file contained embedded macros that, when enabled, executed a JavaScript launcher to download and deploy the fictional 'BlackByte' ransomware variant. Upon execution, the malware employed the Windows Command Shell to run cmd.exe with parameters for initial setup and to modify system configurations. For persistence, the actors replaced Microsoft Outlook's VbaProject.OTM file to install a backdoor macro that activates on application startup, and they created a directory at /Library/StartupItems to ensure the malware runs at system boot. After establishing a foothold, the malware conducted network service discovery using tools like NBTscan to scan IP networks for vulnerable hosts and performed security software discovery to detect and evade anti-virus processes on the infected system. Additionally, it executed system language discovery to identify the victim's locale settings. The actors abused Remote Desktop Software such as TeamViewer to gain interactive remote control over compromised systems, and they used data encoding techniques, decoding base64-encoded commands received from the controller to execute further malicious actions. Logs from the institution's SIEM showed anomalous network traffic and failed login attempts, though these were unrelated to the tagged techniques. The company, 'Global Finance Corp', has a history of prior security incidents, but this scenario is fictional for training. Response efforts included isolating affected systems and updating firewall rules, with no actual data loss reported in this exercise.",
