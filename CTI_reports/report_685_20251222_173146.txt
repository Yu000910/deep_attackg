The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams about a fictional APT campaign designated 'ShadowCompiler.' This campaign targeted 'InnovateSoft Inc.,' a mid-sized software development company, with the goal of deploying ransomware across its customer base. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1591] by gathering victim organization information, including employee hierarchies and press releases, and used large language models (LLMs) to identify potential targets of interest. Subsequently, they acquired infrastructure [T1583] by utilizing free cloud service trials to host malicious payloads, evading legitimate business filters. The attack began with a supply chain compromise [T1195], where the adversary modified the compiler executable at InnovateSoft to inject backdoor code into all compiled applications, enabling widespread infection. Upon execution, the malware established persistence by creating a malicious systemd timer [T1053.006] to execute ransomware every 24 hours and invoked Netsh.exe to add a helper DLL [T1546.007] that triggers on every network configuration change, while simultaneously bypassing User Account Control [T1548.002] by modifying registry keys to disable remote restrictions. For lateral movement, the actors forged web credentials [T1606] by exploiting the AWS AssumeRole API to generate temporary credentials for unauthorized access to S3 buckets, and maintained command and control through bidirectional communication [T1102.002] using the Microsoft Graph API to access an attacker-controlled OneDrive account for retrieving payloads and backdoor commands. System logs from InnovateSoft showed anomalous network traffic to cloud IPs, but initial alerts were dismissed as false positives due to the use of legitimate-looking domains. The company's background includes developing custom applications for healthcare clients, with no prior major security incidents reported.
