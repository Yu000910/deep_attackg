Ember Bear, a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has been observed conducting a multi-phase campaign against technology and financial sectors. Initial reconnaissance involved scanning public repositories for exploitation scripts against known vulnerabilities [T1588.005], while spear-phishing campaigns delivered weaponized Excel documents with embedded macros [T1566] and created fake Pinterest boards with malicious links claiming free design templates [T1566.003]. Upon execution, the adversary employed Lua scripts through a Windows interpreter [T1059.011] to download malicious payloads, including a keylogger DLL injected into winlogon.exe using mavinject.exe [T1218.013]. Privilege escalation was achieved by exploiting world-writable configuration files [T1548.004] and abusing sudo to run privileged processes without authentication [T1548]. In cloud environments, the actor executed 'docker exec -it container_name /bin/bash' to gain shell access [T1609] and edited Apache configurations to add SSLEngine on with a malicious certificate file [T1608.003]. For evasion, the malware modified sleep times from default 20-22 seconds [T1497.003] and collected system time data [T1124]. Network activities included using AWS Traffic Mirroring to sniff unencrypted credentials [T1040] and leveraging SNMP to dump firewall rule sets [T1602.001]. Data exfiltration involved stealing web session cookies [T1539] and extracting code-signing certificates from the Windows store to sign malicious executables [T1649], with all C2 communications encrypted by BITTER malware [T1573]. Logs from affected systems show increased network traffic and unauthorized access attempts, though some entries were unrelated to user login failures.
