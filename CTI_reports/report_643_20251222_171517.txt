The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a simulated advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign dubbed 'ShadowHook'. This fictional scenario is based on observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) targeting financial organizations, with no real-world incidents reported. Background: The campaign is attributed to a fictional group mimicking known APT behaviors, focusing on data exfiltration and disruption. System logs from a simulated environment show unusual PowerShell activity and network anomalies starting in early 2024, but these are training artifacts. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify targets. In the initial access phase, the adversary exploited a vulnerable Microsoft Exchange server [T1190] to gain entry into the network, while simultaneously using a PowerShell script named phishing.ps1 to harvest email account credentials [T1586.002] from compromised users. Upon execution, the malware hijacked legitimate COM objects [T1559] to load and execute malicious code in memory, evading detection by leveraging application shim databases [T1546.011] for persistence. For further persistence, the attacker employed the trap command [T1546.005] to run a backdoor script upon receiving SIGTERM signals, ensuring continued access. In credential access, an automated tool performed password guessing attacks [T1110.001] against exposed Telnet ports using previously breached credentials, attempting lateral movement. Command and control was established through an encrypted channel [T1573] using a custom algorithm for communication, with instructions retrieved via a dead drop resolver [T1102.001] that wrote encoded C2 data to dead_drop_resolver.txt hosted on a public GitHub repository. In the impact phase, the actor executed data destruction [T1485] by overwriting and deleting critical files to disrupt operations. Additional logs show benign system updates and user login failures unrelated to the attack, included for realism in training scenarios.
