On 2023-10-15, a critical infrastructure organization in the energy sector reported anomalous network activity, prompting an investigation by the FBI, CISA, and NSA. The fictional APT group 'ShadowStrike' likely initiated reconnaissance by scraping the victim's public-facing 'Our Clients' webpage to identify business relationships and potential supply chain vulnerabilities [T1591.002]. Following this, actors employed spearphishing emails with PDF attachments containing malicious links that redirected to credential harvesting websites, exploiting stolen domain administrator credentials for initial access and lateral movement across the compromised network [T1598.003, T1078.002]. Once inside, the adversary executed commands via the network device CLI, such as 'no cdp run', to disable neighbor discovery protocols and obscure their presence while simultaneously configuring cron jobs to schedule payload retrieval from actor-controlled infrastructure [T1059.008, T1053.003]. To maintain persistence, malicious scripts were embedded within legitimate Microsoft-signed executables, enabling proxy execution to bypass security controls and exfiltrate sensitive data from network shared drives [T1216, T1039]. Additionally, remote desktop software like TeamViewer was abused to establish a persistent interactive command and control channel, facilitating further data collection and staging for exfiltration [T1219.002]. In a disruptive phase, the actors launched a service exhaustion flood by exploiting SSL/TLS renegotiation vulnerabilities to create persistent connections that drained server memory, aiming to degrade operational capabilities [T1499.002]. System logs from the victim's environment showed increased CPU usage on core servers, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured monitoring tools. The organization, which specializes in renewable energy solutions, had recently expanded its digital footprint, making it a high-value target. Analysis of network traffic revealed encrypted outbound connections to IP addresses associated with known malicious infrastructure, though some were false positives from legitimate cloud services. This campaign underscores the need for robust endpoint detection and proactive threat hunting in critical sectors.
