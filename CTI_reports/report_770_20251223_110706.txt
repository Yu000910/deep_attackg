The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign observed in simulated environments. APT-FICT, a threat actor with suspected ties to fictional nation-state interests, has been targeting critical infrastructure entities, including energy and manufacturing sectors, since early 2024. In one simulated incident, the actor compromised a mid-sized industrial control systems (ICS) provider, 'SecureTech Inc.', leading to data exfiltration and potential operational disruption. Initial analysis indicates the campaign follows a structured kill-chain approach.

**Reconnaissance Phase:** APT-FICT actors likely conduct reconnaissance by systematically searching victim-owned websites for sitemap.xml files to compile a complete list of URLs [T1594]. They then queried the company's internal directory exposed on their public website to identify key roles and personnel [T1591.004]. Additionally, the attacker used nmap.exe to scan the network and identify hosts with specific hardware configurations, such as industrial programmable logic controllers (PLCs) [T1592.001]. SecureTech's firewall logs from March 2024 show anomalous outbound traffic to unknown IP addresses, though this was not immediately flagged as malicious.

**Weaponization and Delivery:** The threat actor developed a custom buffer overflow exploit targeting a specific vulnerability in SecureTech's web server software [T1587.004]. Malware operators used compromised GitHub accounts to store and retrieve command and control configuration data, leveraging these web services for operational security [T1584.006]. A simulated payload, dubbed 'USBferry', was designed to copy its installer to attached USB storage devices for replication through removable media [T1091]. Incident responders noted that the malware's command-and-control (C2) infrastructure dynamically resolved for randomly-generated subdomains within a parent domain to avoid static blocking [T1568], and FIN6 has historically used Pastebin and Google Storage to host content for their operations, though APT-FICT's use remains unconfirmed in this scenario [T1102].

**Exploitation and Installation:** Upon execution, the payload utilized COM object instantiation to load and execute a rogue DLL without writing to disk, enhancing stealth [T1559.001]. The malicious DLL was exploited to bypass code signing requirements on the system, a technique for defense evasion [T1211]. SpicyOmelette, another component, has the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on compromised hosts to perform lateral movement [T1059.007]. ZxShell can collect the owner and organization information from the target workstation for further targeting [T1033]. System logs from infected hosts showed unusual PowerShell activity, but no immediate alerts were triggered.

**Persistence and Actions on Objectives:** For persistence, the attacker wrote a malicious PowerShell script named evil.ps1 to the Windows Startup folder, ensuring execution at boot or logon [T1037]. Malware altered the postinstall script of a system utility to run a persistence mechanism after installation, using installer packages for stealth [T1546.016]. APT-FICT's objectives in this simulation included data theft and potential sabotage, with exfiltration observed over encrypted channels. SecureTech's security team, upon review, identified gaps in endpoint detection and response (EDR) coverage, highlighting the need for improved monitoring of scripting and COM activities.
