    "clean_text": "On October 15, 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA observed suspicious activity in a financial institution's network, traced to a phishing campaign with malicious attachments. Initial analysis revealed that the actors conducted reconnaissance to identify domain accounts and cloud resources, leading to the deployment of Mimikatz.exe to extract Kerberos tickets and domain credentials while simultaneously creating a rogue Lambda function with a backdoor to execute unauthorized commands in the cloud environment. The attack progressed with the adversary employing JavaScript to execute additional malicious payloads, which injected code into trusted processes via the Asynchronous Procedure Call queue and used process hollowing to inject into target processes like Svchost and Explorer. System logs from the compromised server, running Windows Server 2019 with standard security patches, showed unusual network traffic spikes at 02:00 UTC, unrelated to the attack but noted for context. To restore command and control channels after network disruption, the malicious process launched 'reconnect_tool.exe' utilizing Domain Generation Algorithms, and attackers exploited Bluetooth pairing protocol weaknesses to transfer stolen credentials to a nearby device. The company, a mid-sized regional bank with hybrid on-premises and AWS infrastructure, reported no financial loss but initiated incident response procedures, including isolating affected systems and reviewing cloud configurations.",
