The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training insights into a fictional APT campaign designated 'Silent Stream.' This campaign targets organizations in the financial and technology sectors, exploiting trusted platforms to infiltrate networks and maintain long-term access. Background analysis indicates that the actor likely operates from Eastern Europe, with infrastructure logs showing sporadic activity over the past six months, though no real-world incidents have been reported.

Initial Access: The actors began by compromising a legitimate GitHub account [T1584.006] to push malicious code updates to popular open-source software projects, which were then downloaded by unsuspecting users. Concurrently, they delivered BLINDINGCAN malware via spearphishing emails containing malicious Microsoft Office attachments [T1566.001], exploiting macros to gain initial footholds in victim environments. System logs from affected endpoints show unusual PowerShell executions at 03:14 UTC, but these were initially dismissed as benign updates.

Execution and Persistence: Upon execution, the malware injected its code into a trusted system process, such as svchost.exe, to blend in with normal activity and establish a botnet for coordinated attacks [T1584.005]. The actor then utilized Azure RunCommand to execute reconnaissance commands on virtual machines, gathering system information and network configurations [T1651]. To maintain persistence, they altered the registry key HKCR\CLSID\{87654321-4321-4321-4321-210987654321} to load a malicious DLL when Microsoft Management Console (MMC) opens [T1218.014], ensuring the payload activates during administrative tasks. Additionally, they employed tscon.exe to hijack established RDP sessions by exploiting session management vulnerabilities, allowing them to take control of remote desktops without authentication prompts [T1563.002].

Command and Control (C2): For C2 communications, Silent Stream acquired dedicated servers to host second-stage payloads that remain active for extended periods, from days to months, providing reliable infrastructure for data exfiltration [T1583.004]. The remote access tool employed RSA encryption for C2 communications to avoid signature detection [T1573], while also using AES ciphertext to encode specific commands and data streams, enhancing stealth through symmetric cryptography [T1573.001]. Network traffic analysis revealed encrypted packets routed through cloud services, mimicking legitimate HTTPS traffic, with decryption keys stored in memory to evade disk-based scans.

Impact and Evasion: In later stages, the actor demonstrated advanced evasion by writing a Dockerfile that copied encrypted payloads into container filesystems, enabling them to build malicious images on host systems and deploy them in cloud environments [T1612]. This technique allowed the malware to operate within isolated containers, bypassing traditional host-based defenses. The campaign culminated in the attacker modifying the homepage of a compromised web server to display fake cryptocurrency donation requests, as part of an external defacement aimed at financial fraud [T1491.002]. Incident response teams noted altered HTML files and redirected DNS queries, though full recovery was achieved within 48 hours after isolating affected systems.

Mitigation recommendations include implementing application allowlisting, monitoring for unusual registry changes, and enforcing multi-factor authentication on cloud administrative interfaces. This report serves as a training tool for blue teams to recognize and respond to complex, multi-technique attacks in realistic scenarios.
