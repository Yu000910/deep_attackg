The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with a realistic training scenario based on fictional APT activity. In this simulated campaign, designated 'Operation Dream Job', actors likely conduct reconnaissance by identifying specific employee roles [T1591.004] and business partners [T1591.002] through corporate websites, while also searching dark web forums for target information [T1597]. The initial access phase involved phishing emails [T1566] containing links to compromised websites that distributed a malicious Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with embedded data exfiltration tools [T1204.003]. Upon execution, the adversary employed Azure PowerShell [T1059.009] to enumerate virtual machines in the cloud environment and simultaneously extracted password hashes from /etc/shadow [T1003.008]. To maintain persistence, the threat actor used certutil -encode to forge authentication certificates [T1649] and implemented command and control (C2) by mimicking legitimate cloud service API traffic patterns with junk data [T1001.001]. Finally, the campaign concluded with stored data manipulation, where malicious scripts modified Access database records to corrupt inventory management information [T1565.001]. System logs from the victim environment showed routine HTTP requests to internal servers on port 443, with no anomalies detected prior to the incident. The organization, a mid-sized manufacturing firm, reported no financial impact during this training exercise, but highlighted gaps in cloud security monitoring.
