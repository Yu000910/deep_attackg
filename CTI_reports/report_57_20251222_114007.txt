On 2024-10-01, a financial services company, 'SecureBank Inc.', reported anomalous network activity traced back to a spearphishing campaign. APT 'ShadowLink' likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify high-value targets within the organization, though no specific logs confirm this. The actors sent spearphishing emails containing malicious links [T1566.002] that mimicked legitimate internal notifications, leading users to a fake system error page. Upon interaction, the page prompted users to copy and paste malicious PowerShell commands [T1204.004] into an elevated terminal, which executed a payload that downloaded additional tools [T1105] while modifying system configurations [T1112]. Following execution, the adversary created new local accounts with administrative privileges [T1098.007] to maintain persistence, leveraging short-cycle credential rotation policies. They then injected a malicious DLL into the svchost.exe process memory using Windows API calls [T1574] to hijack execution flow and evade detection. System logs from 2024-10-02 show NBTscan activity that listed active users [T1033], indicating reconnaissance for lateral movement. The actors utilized the WebDAV protocol [T1021] to execute payloads hosted on network file shares, facilitating remote access. For command and control, they established one-way communication via GitLab repositories [T1102.003] to receive instructions without generating bidirectional traffic. Finally, automated scripts exfiltrated stolen financial data to Dropbox [T1020], with logs showing large file transfers during off-hours. Incident responders noted unrelated firewall alerts for port scans, but these were determined to be false positives from routine network maintenance.
