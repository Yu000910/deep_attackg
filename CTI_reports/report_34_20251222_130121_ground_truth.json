    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional APT campaign for educational purposes. CrimsonVortex actors likely conduct reconnaissance by establishing fake social media accounts, such as a Facebook persona posing as a recruiter, to gather intelligence on target organizations. Initial access was achieved by exploiting a known vulnerability in a SOHO router's firmware, allowing the actors to pivot into the network. Execution involved a supply chain compromise where the adversary altered the continuous integration server configuration to deploy malware-laden software updates to customers, which included a drive-by attack that injected malicious JavaScript into an e-commerce site's payment processing script [T1195, T1608.004]. The malware then used PowerShell to download a backdoored Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the AWS marketplace, containing pre-installed credential harvesting tools. Persistence was maintained by modifying registry keys and employing symmetric cryptography, with GreyEnergy encrypting communications using AES256 to evade detection. Exfiltration occurred over multiple channels: OilBooster used an actor-controlled OneDrive account for command and control (C2) communication and data exfiltration, while the ransomware connected to a public WiFi network to send encryption keys to its command server. Finally, the attacker used the PutBucketLifecycle API to set immediate deletion rules for all objects in an S3 bucket, covering their tracks through lifecycle-triggered deletion. System logs from the compromised e-commerce server showed unusual spikes in network traffic, but no direct correlation to the attack was initially detected. The targeted company, 'ShopSecure Inc.,' is a mid-sized online retailer with operations in North America and Europe, though this background information is not directly relevant to the attack techniques. Blue teams should monitor for these behaviors and implement controls to mitigate similar threats.",

The campaign involves a multi-stage attack leveraging supply chain compromises, social engineering, and cloud-based techniques to exfiltrate sensitive data and deploy ransomware. Blue teams should use this report for training to enhance detection and response capabilities against similar tactics.",
