Background: The targeted organization, 'InfraCorp', operates energy grid management systems with a hybrid cloud environment. Initial detection occurred when network administrators, during a routine audit, discovered an unauthorized passive tap device installed on the Ethernet line in the server room, indicating physical access [T1200]. Logs from the affected servers showed unusual activity starting two weeks prior, including failed login attempts from unknown IP addresses, though these were initially dismissed as noise.

Attack Narrative: Following hardware insertion, the adversary exploited an insecure XPC service daemon on a macOS-based administrative workstation to escalate privileges and gain root access [T1559.003]. They then used this access to pivot to the cloud environment, where they employed aws_consoler to create temporary federated credentials for fake users, obfuscating compromised AWS credentials and enabling pivoting from the AWS CLI to console sessions without MFA [T1098.001]. Concurrently, the attacker executed a malicious VBScript hosted on an attacker-controlled website using cscript.exe [T1216.001], which downloaded and extracted obfuscated main code routines hidden within bitmap images as part of anti-analysis techniques [T1027.003]. The payload was delivered as an unsigned MSI package executed with msiexec.exe [T1218.007], allowing for stealthy installation. To maintain persistence and move laterally, the adversary conducted a Pass-the-Hash attack to bypass authentication controls and access sensitive file shares [T1550], while also collecting device configuration details through SNMP GET requests to map the network [T1602.001]. Command and control was established using HTTP traffic where commands were intercepted, parsed for identifiers, and executed, with C2 traffic masquerading as legitimate Google Notifications HTTP requests to evade detection [T1102.003, T1001]. Finally, in the exfiltration phase, the attacker used a boot sector virus to overwrite critical bootloader files with corrupted versions, causing widespread system failures [T1561.002]. Incident response teams noted that backup systems were unaffected, but recovery required significant downtime.

Irrelevant Information: InfraCorp was founded in 1998 and employs over 5,000 staff across 20 countries. The server room temperature logs showed normal fluctuations between 18-22°C during the incident. Employee training records indicated 85% compliance with cybersecurity awareness programs in the last quarter.
