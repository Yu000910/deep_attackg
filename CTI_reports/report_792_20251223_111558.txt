The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide awareness and defensive measures against a fictional APT campaign observed in training simulations. CRIMSON SHADOW actors likely initiated their attack by exploiting a compromised ISP infrastructure to inject malicious content into user traffic, redirecting it through a malicious proxy server [T1659]. This redirection facilitated the delivery of initial payloads to target networks. Upon gaining access, the adversaries executed Python scripts [T1059.006] to download and run additional malware, while simultaneously storing configuration data in registry keys to evade traditional file-based detection [T1027.011]. System logs from affected financial institutions show anomalous outbound connections to IP addresses associated with known malicious domains, though some of these logs were later attributed to routine maintenance activities. To exfiltrate sensitive information, the actors manipulated email systems by creating automatic forwarding rules via Exchange Web Services, specifically targeting emails containing financial terms like 'transaction' or 'wire transfer' and redirecting them to adversary-controlled servers [T1114.003]. The campaign's persistence was maintained through multi-stage channels, where the initial malware downloaded and executed secondary payloads over separate communication channels to adapt to defensive measures [T1104]. Background checks on the ISP revealed no prior security incidents, but internal audits indicated outdated firmware on several routers. The actors' use of these techniques demonstrates a sophisticated approach to maintaining long-term access and data theft, with no evidence of ransomware deployment in this scenario.
