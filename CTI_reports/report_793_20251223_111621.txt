The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide information on a fictional APT campaign attributed to 'Windshift'. This campaign targets a critical infrastructure organization in the energy sector, with the goal of disrupting operations and exfiltrating sensitive data. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify vulnerabilities in web-facing systems. Initial access was achieved through a drive-by compromise [T1189], where employees visited a compromised website that registered custom URL schemes on their systems. Following this, the adversary executed a Lua script [T1059.011] to kill security-related processes and clear event logs, while simultaneously using PowerShell [T1059.001] to download and execute additional payloads on the infected machine [T1102.003]. System logs from the compromised host show unusual network traffic to external IP addresses, but no alerts were triggered due to misconfigured firewall rules. The organization, 'EnergyGrid Corp', has a history of legacy systems and limited security monitoring, which may have facilitated the attack. The actors then leveraged compromised infrastructure to execute container administration commands [T1609], such as 'docker exec production_container iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP', to disrupt SSH access and hinder response efforts. For persistence, they employed template injection [T1221] by altering a docx file to contain an embedded script that connects to a command and control server. The attacker used Set-ADUser to modify the msRADIUSFramedIPAddress attribute on a domain account [T1556.005], implementing reversible encryption to obscure credential storage. Lateral movement was achieved through password cracking [T1110.002], where the threat actor systematically collected switch configuration files to obtain and crack password hashes, while using process discovery [T1057] to retrieve a list of running processes from compromised machines and identify security tools. Network logs indicate repeated failed login attempts across multiple servers, but these were not investigated promptly. The campaign demonstrates a sophisticated blend of techniques aimed at evading detection and maintaining access within the environment.
