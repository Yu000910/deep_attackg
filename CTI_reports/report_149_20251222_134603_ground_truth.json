The malware then leveraged a cloud service provider's free trial to establish temporary command and control infrastructure, and the attacker modified the build automation tool to include a backdoor in the compiled software. During execution, the malware dynamically loaded a malicious DLL using the LoadLibrary function to execute its payload, and in compromised containers, it collected API access tokens from environment variables. For lateral movement, malicious scripts were used to query Smart Install clients for network topology information, and the threat actor leveraged HTTP Referer headers to transmit encoded command data. Exfiltration involved the backdoor encrypting collected system information using RC4 for covert transmission, while it automatically collected sensitive_docs.zip containing financial records from the shared network drive, and the attacker deployed a network sniffer to intercept unencrypted FTP credentials transmitted across the network. System logs from the affected servers showed routine maintenance activities unrelated to the attack, and the targeted organization, a mid-sized bank, had recently updated its firewall policies without incident.",

The actors leveraged supply chain compromise, cloud-based command and control, and network reconnaissance to exfiltrate sensitive data.
