The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the fictional APT group 'Silent Echo' in a simulated campaign against financial organizations. This report is intended for educational training of blue teams to enhance detection and response capabilities.

Background: The victim organization, a mid-sized bank in the U.S., reported anomalous network activity starting in early 2024, including unusual outbound traffic to unknown IP addresses and unauthorized access attempts to sensitive databases. Initial logs from the SIEM showed multiple failed login attempts from external IPs, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured thresholds.

Attack Narrative:
1. Reconnaissance: The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by purchasing technical data from commercial IP geolocation databases [T1597.002] to map the physical locations of the victim's servers, followed by scanning IP blocks using ICMP timestamp requests [T1595.001] to assess network device availability and identify potential entry points. Additionally, they employed spearphishing voice calls [T1598.004] to gather voice samples for biometric spoofing, targeting IT staff under the guise of customer service inquiries.
2. Initial Access: The adversary gained initial access by compromising the software supply chain [T1195.002], exploiting a vulnerability in a third-party financial software update distributed to the victim, which allowed the injection of malicious code into trusted applications.
3. Execution and Persistence: Upon execution, the malware used inter-process communication via pipes [T1559] to redirect standard input and output between processes, while modifying the com.apple.loginwindow.plist file to load a launch daemon [T1543.004] for persistence on macOS systems, ensuring malicious code activation during user login sessions. It also employed fork() to break process trees [T1036.009], creating multiple child processes under a benign parent to evade detection by security tools.
4. Defense Evasion and Privilege Escalation: To bypass security mechanisms, the threat actor executed 'bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON' to modify code signing policies [T1553.006], circumventing Windows driver signing requirements, and used VBA stomping [T1564.007] to execute p-code from a compromised Access database, initiating data exfiltration while obfuscating malicious macros.
5. Credential Access and Lateral Movement: The actors deployed Mimikatz.exe for password cracking [T1110.002] to dump credentials from the Windows credential vault, collected web session cookies [T1550.004] from browser storage to bypass multi-factor authentication, and performed pass the ticket attacks [T1550.003] by injecting a golden ticket to gain unauthorized access to domain resources, enabling lateral movement across the network.
6. Collection and Exfiltration: The malware queried the Microsoft Teams API [T1213.005] to collect user credentials and authentication tokens from messaging applications, and the backdoor employed SMB read operations [T1071.002] to periodically check for new commands from the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, facilitating data exfiltration over file transfer protocols.

Irrelevant Information: The victim's internal audit revealed that several employees had not completed mandatory security training in the past quarter, and network logs indicated routine maintenance activities coinciding with the attack timeline, though these were unrelated to the incident. The organization's backup systems were last tested six months prior, with no anomalies reported.

Recommendations: Blue teams should monitor for unusual network scanning, enforce strict software supply chain controls, implement application whitelisting, and conduct regular credential hygiene audits to mitigate similar threats.
