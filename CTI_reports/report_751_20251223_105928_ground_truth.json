    "clean_text": "Ember Bear, a simulated advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has been observed conducting a multi-stage campaign against technology firms. The actors likely obtained exploitation scripts from public repositories and malware downloaded via a disposable email account from a file hosting service. During the initial access phase, the adversary compromised the software supply chain by injecting credential harvesting code into a source repository. Upon execution, malicious code exploited COM interfaces to create and execute remote script components while simultaneously hijacking the 'libsqlite3.dylib' library to load command and control modules. The malware then performed reconnaissance using PowerShell to enumerate Azure Active Directory groups and email accounts via Get-GlobalAddressList, while also listing connected peripheral devices with ADVSTORESHELL. Data collection involved querying SharePoint repositories for sensitive documentation and executing git pull operations to gather updated source code from remote repositories. Input capture was achieved by hooking the CredUIPromptForWindowsCredentials API to log authentication prompts. Command and control communications utilized DNS protocols, and in a final disruptive phase, the malware corrupted embedded controller firmware to impair system functionality. System logs from the target environment showed routine network traffic and user login attempts, with no immediate alerts triggered during early stages. The organization, a mid-sized software developer, reported unusual system crashes and performance degradation post-incident.",
