    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign, 'ShadowScribe,' which has been observed targeting energy sector entities in North America. This scenario is based on simulated activities designed to educate defensive teams on complex attack chains.\n\nBackground: The victim organization, 'EnergiCorp,' is a mid-sized utility company with operations across three states. Initial logs from their SIEM showed anomalous network traffic spikes, but routine audits had not flagged any critical issues prior to the incident.\n\nAttack Narrative: The actors likely began by conducting reconnaissance, scouring EnergiCorp's public website for physical facility locations and employee contact details to identify potential entry points. Subsequently, they compromised the software supply chain, infiltrating a third-party vendor's repository to substitute a legitimate software update package with a malicious executable that was distributed to EnergiCorp's systems. Upon execution, the malware exploited an XPC service daemon's weak authentication, gaining elevated system access and deploying a payload that initiated further actions. To propagate within the network, the threat actors used malicious links in phishing emails, which, when opened by employees, executed QakBot-like malware to establish initial footholds. Once inside, they employed DCSync with compromised privileged accounts to replicate directory service data from domain controllers, while simultaneously conducting password spraying against SSH services to harvest additional credentials, as observed in packet captures. For lateral movement, the actors performed network service discovery using living-off-the-land (LOTL) utilities to map active services and systems, then utilized alternate authentication material, such as Pass-the-Hash techniques, to authenticate to multiple workstations without needing plaintext passwords. Exfiltration was conducted over web protocols, with data being transmitted via HTTPS and WebDav to command-and-control servers. In a final disruptive phase, the attackers weaponized a zero-day vulnerability in EnergiCorp's database management system, causing persistent unavailability of business-critical applications to obscure their tracks and hinder recovery efforts. Post-incident analysis revealed that standard firewall rules had not blocked the malicious traffic, highlighting gaps in network monitoring.",

Based on observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), the actors conducted reconnaissance, compromised software supply chains, exploited vulnerabilities, and employed credential-based attacks to gain persistent access and exfiltrate sensitive data. The report is intended for blue team training to enhance detection and response capabilities against similar multi-stage attacks.",
