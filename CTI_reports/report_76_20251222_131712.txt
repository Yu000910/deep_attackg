On October 15, 2023, multiple organizations in the energy sector reported suspicious activity, including unauthorized access and system disruptions. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance via open-source intelligence gathering to identify key personnel [T1589]. The attack began with a spearphishing campaign where threat actors made phone calls [T1566.004] to employees, posing as IT support and directing them to download a remote access trojan disguised as a document viewer from a compromised website. Victims were tricked into executing the malicious file [T1204.002], which initiated a PowerShell script that downloaded additional payloads [T1105] while simultaneously modifying registry keys to establish persistence [T1112]. Upon execution, the malware employed a pre-OS boot technique by injecting malicious code into the UEFI firmware [T1542], creating a persistent foothold that survives disk formatting and reboots. The adversary then used PowerShell to query Azure Active Directory [T1069.003], discovering user group affiliations to escalate privileges and map the cloud environment. Additionally, the malware executed commands via WMI to check for installed antivirus products [T1518.001], evading detection by disabling security software. For command and control (C2), the actors utilized fast flux DNS [T1568.001], rapidly changing IP addresses to mask the true location of their servers and maintain communication. In later stages, the campaign involved firmware corruption [T1495], where a malicious flash utility overwrote BIOS firmware to permanently disable motherboards, causing hardware failures. System logs from affected devices show anomalous network traffic to domains like 'update-secure[.]net', but no data exfiltration was confirmed. The company, 'EnergyGrid Inc.', reported no prior incidents, and background checks revealed standard cybersecurity protocols were in place. Analysis indicates the campaign aimed at disruption rather than data theft, with potential links to fictional state-sponsored groups. Remediation includes updating firmware, monitoring for UEFI anomalies, and training employees on social engineering threats.
