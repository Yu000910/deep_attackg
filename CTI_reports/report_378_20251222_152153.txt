APT-99, a fictional advanced persistent threat group, has been observed conducting cyber operations against organizations in the energy and telecommunications sectors. The group likely obtained a custom keylogger and Cobalt Strike payloads from underground forums to enhance their capabilities [T1588, T1588.001]. Initial access was achieved by exploiting a known vulnerability, CVE-2023-3519, in a Citrix NetScaler application, allowing remote code execution [T1190]. Upon compromise, the actors used AppleScript [T1059.002] to inject malicious JavaScript into web browsers, facilitating further payload delivery. System logs from the affected server show unusual network traffic spikes, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured monitoring tools. To establish persistence, APT-99 modified the TimeProviders registry key to execute malicious code at system boot [T1547.003] and manipulated the com.apple.loginwindow.UUID.plist file to re-open a data exfiltration tool upon user login [T1547.007]. Background checks on the compromised organization revealed no prior security incidents, but outdated software was a contributing factor. For reconnaissance, the actors leveraged a compromised host to query Smart Install protocols on Cisco switches, dumping IOS configuration files to map network topology [T1602.002]. Additionally, a malicious script was deployed to automatically copy command instructions to any inserted USB flash drive, enabling covert communication [T1092]. Incident responders noted that the attack spanned multiple days, with data exfiltration occurring during off-peak hours to avoid detection.
