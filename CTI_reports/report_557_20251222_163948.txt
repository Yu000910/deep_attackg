On June 15, 2024, a mid-sized financial firm, 'SecureBank Inc.', reported anomalous network activity, prompting an investigation by internal security teams. SecureBank, headquartered in New York with 500 employees, operates primarily in retail banking and investment services. Initial logs from their Microsoft 365 environment showed unusual login attempts from unrecognized IP addresses, but these were initially dismissed as false positives due to a recent system update. The attack began with the adversary sending a targeted spearphishing email [T1566.001] to a senior accountant, which contained a malicious PDF attachment disguised as an invoice. Upon opening the attachment, the victim inadvertently executed a script that leveraged a command-line interpreter [T1059] to download and install a backdoor, while simultaneously dropping a malicious IDE extension [T1176.002] into the Visual Studio 2019 folder for persistence. The backdoor then modified startup items [T1037.005] to ensure execution upon system boot and installed a backdoored firmware version [T1542.002] on the server's baseboard management controller to maintain access even after reboots. Once established, the malware conducted process discovery [T1057] to identify running applications and used pass-the-hash techniques [T1550.002] with stolen credentials to authenticate to remote Windows systems, enabling lateral movement across the network. The actors then collected data from cloud storage [T1530] by accessing Microsoft 365 environments and employed an internal proxy [T1090.001] to route traffic between infected hosts for stealthy communication. Finally, they utilized dynamic resolution [T1568] through DNS tunneling to covertly exfiltrate the stolen data via DNS queries, evading traditional network monitoring tools. SecureBank's incident response team noted that the attack was detected after a spike in DNS traffic, but initial alerts were delayed due to misconfigured firewall rules.
