On October 15, 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory in response to observed activity by the advanced persistent threat (APT) group 'ShadowNet'. This fictional campaign targets financial organizations in North America, with initial access gained through spearphishing emails containing malicious links [T1204.001] that redirected users to compromised websites hosting credential-harvesting pages. Once a user clicked the link, the adversary leveraged valid local accounts [T1078.003] to execute commands via PowerShell, while simultaneously using a simulated HID USB device to inject keystrokes [T1674] and modify system settings. The malware then altered DNS server configurations [T1584.002] to redirect queries for banking websites to phishing servers, and employed DHCP spoofing [T1557.003] to assign malicious gateway addresses, redirecting all client traffic through attacker-controlled nodes. During the execution phase, the threat actor queried Confluence pages [T1213.001] to extract database schema diagrams and connection strings, staging collected data locally [T1074.001] in a working directory before exfiltrating it using the SMB protocol [T1071.002] to blend malicious traffic with normal file server activity. System logs from the affected environment show increased network latency and unusual DNS queries, but no actual data loss occurred as this was a training exercise. The company, 'SecureBank Inc.', reported no financial impact, but the simulation highlighted vulnerabilities in user awareness and network segmentation.
