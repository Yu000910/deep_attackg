APT-FICT actors likely conducted reconnaissance by scraping employee names from public-facing staff biographies [T1589.003] to craft targeted phishing campaigns. The penetration tester identified an active Guest account using common default password lists, which the adversary exploited for initial access [T1078.001]. Once inside, the actors employed AWS Systems Manager Run Command [T1072] to execute a reconnaissance script across multiple AWS accounts while simultaneously modifying account credentials using Mimikatz modules like LSADUMP::ChangeNTLM to manipulate password hashes without clear text values [T1098]. To maintain persistence, the threat actor configured the AllUsers profile.ps1 [T1546.013] to run reconnaissance scripts during PowerShell startup, enabling automated execution upon user login. For lateral movement, the attacker exploited stolen SSH private keys [T1563.001] to authenticate to multiple systems in the network, querying SNMP to gather network device configurations [T1602.002] for mapping the infrastructure. To evade detection, the actors modified URI endpoints by adding random query parameters [T1001.003] to disguise command and control (C2) traffic, which was used to automate exfiltration of documents matching specific extensions to C2 servers [T1020]. Additionally, the adversary utilized USB devices [T1052.001] to collect system information and network configurations from compromised machines, while secretly installing mining software that hijacked system resources to generate cryptocurrency revenue [T1496]. Throughout the campaign, APT-FICT leveraged a combination of these techniques to achieve their objectives, with logs showing increased CPU usage on several servers and network traffic spikes during exfiltration phases. The target organization, a fictional energy provider, reported no operational disruptions, but the simulation highlights vulnerabilities in default account management and insufficient monitoring of cloud deployment tools.
