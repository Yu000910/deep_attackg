SilentTide, a fictional APT group, likely conducted reconnaissance on financial targets, though specific indicators were not captured in this scenario. The attack began with a phishing campaign [T1566], where a malicious Word document with enabled content was distributed to employees, executing a PowerShell script to establish persistence. To enhance legitimacy, the actors purchased code signing certificates through a front organization [T1588.003] and used them to sign the malicious payloads, which were then uploaded to a compromised GitHub account's repository for staging [T1608.001]. During execution, the adversary employed Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) [T1047] to enable lateral movement across the network while simultaneously modifying registry keys to disable the Windows Defender service [T1553] and using cacls to grant write access to backup folders for data exfiltration [T1222.001]. The attackers exploited vulnerable SMB services running on port 445 [T1210] identified via an nmap scan, and in one instance, leveraged a passive network tap to capture unencrypted credentials [T1200]. For privilege escalation, they used an obfuscated exploit to abuse named-pipe impersonation for local SYSTEM access [T1134], and modified the portable executable's resource section to hide additional malicious code using Thread Local Storage [T1055.005]. Security software discovery was conducted by comparing running processes against an encrypted list of security programs and terminating them [T1518.001]. The actors also used raw sockets to craft custom packets for traffic signaling, opening hidden backdoor ports [T1205], and prompted users for credentials via GUI input capture [T1056.002]. Data exfiltration involved leveraging Git to access and extract financial records from a version-controlled database [T1213.003], and in a separate incident, attackers used AWS SNS to send premium-rate SMS messages to multiple phone numbers [T1496.003]. System logs from the targeted environment showed routine backup activities and network traffic spikes unrelated to the attack, with no prior alerts from the compromised GitHub account. The company, a mid-sized regional bank, had recently updated its firewall policies, but legacy systems remained vulnerable.
