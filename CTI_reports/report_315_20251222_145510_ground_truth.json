The organization, headquartered in New York with 5,000 employees, reported unusual login attempts to their Microsoft Dynamics 365 platform. Initial logs showed failed authentication events from unrecognized domains, prompting a deeper investigation.\n\nThe adversary likely conducted reconnaissance by searching open technical databases, such as WHOIS, to identify domain registration details of SecureBank Inc. and its subsidiaries. Based on this intelligence, the actors registered multiple domains to facilitate payload staging and command-and-control (C2) operations, while also compromising existing domains for infrastructure, including C2 servers and malware staging sites. To develop capabilities, they created malicious npm packages designed for delivery to or retrieval by victims, mimicking legitimate software updates. The attack began with initial access through an open Wi-Fi network at a satellite office, where the malware exploited weak encryption to establish a foothold. Once inside, the malware replicated through removable media by modifying Autorun.inf files to automatically execute when USB drives were connected to infected systems.\n\nFor execution, the dropper employed AutoHotKey to write malicious scripts that simulated administrative actions, disabling security software while simultaneously using execution guardrails like 'net share' commands to discover accessible file shares for data exfiltration. To evade detection, attackers used space after filename techniques, renaming 'malware.dll' to 'annual_report.docx ' to mask its true nature. The malicious script then executed DCSync attacks via the Mimikatz lsadump module to dump domain credential hashes from Active Directory, leveraging application access tokens to query financial APIs with hijacked tokens for unauthorized fund transfers. For collection, the actor used remote data staging through cmd.exe to gather network configuration data, storing it centrally, and exploited customer relationship management software by using compromised credentials to access Microsoft Dynamics 365 and harvest customer data. Throughout the campaign, the adversary conducted ingress tool transfer to download additional files to victim machines, and in the final stage, performed disk structure wipes by retrieving device handles to \\\\.\\PhysicalDrive0 to corrupt boot sectors, aiming to disrupt recovery efforts. System logs from SecureBank Inc. showed increased CPU usage on domain controllers during these activities, but no actual data loss occurred in this training scenario.",
