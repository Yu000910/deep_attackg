The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide a fictional, educational overview of a simulated APT campaign. This report is based on a constructed attack scenario for training purposes and does not reflect current real-world threats. Background: The fictional victim is a mid-sized technology firm, 'InnovateCorp', with operations in cloud services and software development. System logs from InnovateCorp's web servers show increased traffic anomalies prior to the incident, but these were initially flagged as false positives due to routine maintenance activities. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify potential targets, though specific details are omitted here for brevity. In the initial access phase, the adversary exploited a strategic web compromise by embedding malicious code in a legitimate-looking industry news website, leading to a drive-by compromise [T1189] that redirected victims to a controlled server. Upon successful compromise, the threat actors executed malicious Lua code [T1059.011] to inject a dynamic-link library (DLL) into a running PowerShell process [T1055.001], enabling stealthy payload execution and evasion of endpoint detection systems. For persistence, the actors modified registry keys to change the default file association for HWP documents [T1546.001] and added a malicious library path to AppInit_DLLs [T1546.010], ensuring the malware loaded automatically on system startup. To further evade defenses, the actors downloaded source code files from remote addresses and compiled them locally using GCC in the victim environment [T1027.004], while simultaneously disabling or modifying cloud logs [T1562.008] by removing SNS topics configured for security alert notifications. During lateral movement, the adversary hijacked an established Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session [T1563] and used Kerberos ticket attacks, specifically pass the ticket techniques [T1550.003], to move across the network and access sensitive systems. For command and control, the actors employed asymmetric cryptography [T1573.002] over HTTPS to securely communicate with compromised servers, mimicking legitimate traffic patterns. Additional system logs from InnovateCorp's internal monitoring tools showed unusual registry modifications and network connections, but these were not immediately correlated due to the actors' evasion efforts. This scenario underscores the importance of comprehensive logging, threat intelligence integration, and proactive defense strategies in mitigating sophisticated cyber threats.
