The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on the activities of the fictional threat actor group 'Crimson Harvest,' which has been observed in training scenarios targeting financial organizations. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify key personnel, such as HR managers, before initiating their attack. On 2023-10-15, the group sent a phishing email [T1566] with a malicious executable disguised as a resume document, which, when opened by a user, triggered execution [T1204] of the payload via a malicious LNK file, similar to Raspberry Robin tactics. Following initial access, the adversary employed a custom script that extracted database passwords from bash history where users had entered connection commands [T1552], while simultaneously establishing command and control (C2) through bidirectional communication [T1102.002] using the Dropbox cloud storage service for data exchange. The attackers then transferred stolen customer data to their Azure storage account using the Azure Storage REST API [T1537] and exfiltrated the collected data over asymmetric encrypted non-C2 protocols [T1048.002] via HTTPS requests to password-protected archives staged on victim servers, mimicking APT29's SolarWinds compromise. System logs from the victim's environment showed routine network traffic spikes unrelated to the attack, and background checks revealed the organization had recently updated its firewall policies without incident. The campaign underscores the need for enhanced email filtering and credential management in financial sectors.
