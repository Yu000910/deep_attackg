CrimsonViper, a suspected state-sponsored actor, has been observed conducting targeted attacks against financial organizations in North America and Europe. Initial analysis indicates the group leverages paid threat intelligence feeds [T1597.001] to gather detailed information on target email infrastructure, including domain names and server configurations, while also scanning for vulnerabilities in external web applications. The actors then exploit public-facing applications [T1190], such as using known CVEs like CVE-2020-0688 against Microsoft Exchange servers, to gain initial access and execute malicious code. System logs from affected servers show unusual PowerShell activity at 03:45 UTC, but this was not directly linked to the initial breach. Upon execution, CrimsonViper deploys AutoHotKey scripts [T1059.010] to the temp directory, which create scheduled tasks for persistence and modify registry keys to evade detection. Concurrently, the malware attempts account manipulation [T1098] by renaming administrator accounts to obscure its presence, while querying SharePoint lists [T1213.002] to extract internal operational procedures and sensitive documents. The group also employs browser session hijacking [T1185] through web injects that redirect users to fake login pages, capturing credentials for lateral movement. Additionally, CrimsonViper uses protocol impersonation [T1001.003], such as fake TLS communications, to mask command-and-control (C2) traffic and blend with legitimate network activity. Background checks on the organization revealed no prior incidents, but network monitoring detected anomalous outbound connections to IP addresses in Eastern Europe, though these were not confirmed as malicious. This multi-faceted approach allows CrimsonViper to maintain persistence, exfiltrate data, and evade traditional security measures.
