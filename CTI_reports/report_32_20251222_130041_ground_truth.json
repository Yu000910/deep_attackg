    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign, 'ShadowHook,' which simulates advanced threats against critical infrastructure. In this scenario, the actors initiated their campaign by conducting reconnaissance through scraping employee names from the target organization's 'About Us' webpage to craft spear-phishing emails, leveraging this data to gain initial access via a compromised email attachment. Upon execution, the malware replicated through removable media by modifying Autorun.inf files to automatically execute payloads when USB drives were inserted, enabling lateral movement across air-gapped networks. Concurrently, the attackers employed serverless execution by uploading a malicious Python script to an AWS Lambda function to run arbitrary code in a cloud environment, bypassing traditional endpoint defenses. For further reconnaissance, the malware gathered information on local accounts and local groups using commands like `net group` to identify privileged users and group memberships, while also performing internet connection discovery by executing ping.exe to verify network connectivity before establishing command and control (C2) channels. To facilitate covert communication, the actors utilized dynamic resolution by querying DNS records to set up a tunnel for data exfiltration, masking their traffic as legitimate DNS queries. System logs from the training environment showed routine activities, such as scheduled backups and user logins, which were unrelated to the attack, and the fictional company, 'InfraSecure Inc.,' a mid-sized energy provider, reported no operational disruptions during this simulated incident. Blue teams should monitor for anomalies in removable media usage, cloud function executions, and DNS query patterns to detect similar behaviors.",

The activity was observed in a training environment designed to emulate real-world threats, with no actual compromise reported. Blue teams should use this report to enhance detection and response capabilities against similar tactics.",
