The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform organizations about a fictional Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaign, 'SilentBanker,' which has been observed targeting financial institutions in North America and Europe. The actor, believed to operate from an undisclosed region, focuses on stealing banking credentials and transaction data. Background analysis indicates that the campaign began in early 2024, with initial reconnaissance activities detected in system logs showing unusual network scans from IP addresses associated with known malicious infrastructure, though these logs are not directly linked to the primary attack vector. The campaign's kill-chain proceeds as follows: Initial Access: The adversary compromised the software supply chain by inserting malicious code into an open-source library used by financial applications [T1195.002], which was then distributed to victims through routine updates. Execution: Upon installation, the malicious package executed a postinstall script that extracted a hidden plist file from the application's /Resources folder and used launchctl to load it as a Launch Daemon with elevated permissions [T1569.001, T1546.016]. Persistence: This plist file ensured the malware persisted across system reboots, leveraging macOS-specific mechanisms. Command and Control: The actor employed publicly-available tools like Empire for command and control operations [T1588.002], which were acquired from underground forums alongside a banking trojan used for data exfiltration [T1588.001]. Exfiltration: The malware parsed web requests to a targeted server to determine the next stage of execution, using web protocols for data exfiltration [T1071.001]. Incident logs from a fictional financial firm, 'SecureBank Inc.,' show anomalous network traffic spikes coinciding with these activities, though these logs are included for realism and are not tagged as specific techniques. The campaign demonstrates a multi-faceted approach combining supply chain attacks with custom malware and standard tools.
