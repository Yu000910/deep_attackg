The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to document a simulated APT campaign for training purposes. This report is based on fictional intelligence and should be used to improve defensive postures.

Initial Access: The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify vulnerable software update mechanisms. They compromised a widely used development tool by injecting malicious code into an update script, update.ps1, which was distributed to target organizations through a trusted software repository [T1195.001]. Upon execution, this script stole browser cookies and session data to facilitate further access.

Execution: The malicious code employed system services [T1569] by leveraging svchost.exe to load and execute a harmful DLL file, while simultaneously using PowerShell [T1059.001] to download additional payloads [T1105] from a command-and-control (C2) server. System logs from the affected server, SERVER-01, showed unusual process spikes at 02:45 UTC, though initial alerts were dismissed as false positives.

Persistence: To maintain access, the actors wrote a malicious DLL to the Exchange server's transport agent directory to intercept email traffic [T1505.002] and modified registry keys [T1112] to ensure the DLL loaded on system startup. Additionally, they placed encryptor.dll in the Office startup location to execute upon Office application launch [T1137.002], and created a new system process via svchost.exe modification [T1543] to establish persistence across reboots. Background: The targeted company, a mid-sized financial firm, had recently migrated to a hybrid cloud environment, which may have introduced configuration gaps.

Defense Evasion and Lateral Movement: The actors used a patch management system for an anti-virus product, commonly installed among targeted companies, to distribute wiper malware [T1072], while exploiting the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) [T1021.001] to move laterally within the network. They also ran 'net accounts /domain' to discover domain password policy settings [T1201], aiding in credential theft attempts. Network traffic analysis revealed anomalous connections to an IRC server for C2 communications [T1071], though these were initially masked by legitimate web traffic.

Impact and Exfiltration: In a containerized environment, the threat actor wrote a Dockerfile that included cryptocurrency mining software in the container image [T1612], consuming excessive resources on host servers. Finally, they exploited the Bluetooth service discovery protocol to transfer stolen intellectual property [T1011.001], bypassing traditional network monitoring. Incident response teams noted that the company's BYOD policy may have facilitated this exfiltration vector.

This campaign highlights the importance of securing software supply chains, monitoring system services and deployment tools, and implementing robust network segmentation to mitigate similar threats.
