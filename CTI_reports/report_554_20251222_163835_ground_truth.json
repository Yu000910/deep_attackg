    "clean_text": "On October 15, 2023, multiple financial organizations reported anomalous network activity traced back to a watering hole attack on a legitimate software download site, where adversaries conducted reconnaissance to identify targets and then delivered malicious versions of installers through a drive-by compromise. Initial execution occurred when users interacted with these files, executing a malicious document attachment that dropped a payload into a hidden directory to evade detection. The malware then employed PowerShell to call LoadLibraryW and import a custom encryption module from a temporary location as a shared module, while simultaneously writing a malicious MOF file to establish persistence via Windows Management Instrumentation event subscription. For lateral movement, the actors used FindWindow to locate explorer.exe and inject code via ListPlanting, and they leveraged LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning with SMB relay to capture NetNTLM credentials for brute-force attacks, enabling further code execution. Collected sensitive data, including customer records and transaction logs, was archived into password-protected ZIP files before exfiltration over encrypted channels. To ensure continuous access, the campaign involved installing TinyPilot hardware for remote control, bypassing traditional network monitoring. System logs from affected endpoints showed increased CPU usage and unusual outbound connections to IP addresses in Eastern Europe, though some of this activity was later attributed to misconfigured internal services. The targeted organizations, including mid-sized banks and credit unions, had recently updated their firewalls, but legacy systems remained vulnerable due to outdated patch management processes.",
