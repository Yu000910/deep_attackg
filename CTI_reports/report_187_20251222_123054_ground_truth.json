    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training insights into a fictional APT campaign. CrimsonShadow actors likely conducted reconnaissance by systematically querying nameservers to map the target's DNS hierarchy. Following this, they developed custom malware, such as a variant named 'ShadowHive', which was uploaded via a backdoor that saved a remote administration tool from a command-and-control server to establish persistence. The attacker created a Hushmail account with PGP encryption for sensitive data exchange and exploited Azure Managed Identities to maintain persistent access to cloud storage resources. For execution and persistence on macOS systems, the adversary employed AppleScript to create a login item and set a timer using 'timeSetEvent' to schedule its next execution. To modify authentication processes, they replaced legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to collect passwords from numerous applications. Additionally, the malware included capabilities to record screen content in AVI format and used SNMP queries to retrieve ARP table entries from switches. Throughout the campaign, network traffic was obfuscated through base64 -d encoding to avoid detection by security tools. Log analysis from the target's SIEM showed routine system updates and user login attempts, which were unrelated to the attack. The target organization, a mid-sized financial services firm, had recently migrated to a hybrid cloud environment, but no evidence of data loss was confirmed in this training scenario.",
