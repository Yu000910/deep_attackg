Ember Bear, a simulated advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has been observed conducting a multi-stage campaign against technology firms. The actors likely obtained exploitation scripts [T1588.005] from public repositories and malware [T1588.001] downloaded via a disposable email account from a file hosting service. During the initial access phase, the adversary compromised the software supply chain by injecting credential harvesting code into a source repository [T1195.002]. Upon execution, malicious code exploited COM interfaces [T1559] to create and execute remote script components while simultaneously hijacking the 'libsqlite3.dylib' library [T1574.004] to load command and control modules. The malware then performed reconnaissance using PowerShell to enumerate Azure Active Directory groups [T1069.003] and email accounts [T1087.003] via Get-GlobalAddressList, while also listing connected peripheral devices [T1120] with ADVSTORESHELL. Data collection involved querying SharePoint repositories [T1213] for sensitive documentation and executing git pull operations [T1213.003] to gather updated source code from remote repositories. Input capture was achieved by hooking the CredUIPromptForWindowsCredentials API [T1056] to log authentication prompts. Command and control communications utilized DNS protocols [T1071.004], and in a final disruptive phase, the malware corrupted embedded controller firmware [T1495] to impair system functionality. System logs from the target environment showed routine network traffic and user login attempts, with no immediate alerts triggered during early stages. The organization, a mid-sized software developer, reported unusual system crashes and performance degradation post-incident.
