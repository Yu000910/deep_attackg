    "clean_text": "The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by scanning IP blocks to map VoltGrid's network topology, while a fake login page in a phishing email captured victim IP addresses when employees attempted to access it. Initial access was achieved through hardware additions, where attackers dropped multiple USB Rubber Ducky devices in high-traffic areas like corporate cafeterias and parking lots, which, when plugged in, executed malicious scripts. Execution involved a malicious Excel document that displayed a 'Security Warning - Enable Content' prompt, which, when enabled, ran PowerShell commands to download additional payloads. Persistence was established by using sc.exe config to redirect the Telnet service to run a reverse shell payload upon system startup and by writing a PowerShell script path to the StubPath value of an Active Setup component. Privilege escalation and credential access were facilitated through network device CLI usage, where the threat actor modified routing tables with 'ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.1.1.1' to intercept traffic, while credentials were harvested from web browsers and via credential API hooking to spawn system threads. Collection activities included email collection, where exfiltrated email addresses were sent to the C2 server, and command and control was maintained by abusing email accounts to create encrypted tunnels through a free VPN trial. Exfiltration was concealed using protocol or service impersonation, with C2 communications hidden by dynamically changing URI paths between requests. Throughout the campaign, system logs showed routine maintenance activities, such as scheduled backups and software updates, which were unrelated to the attack but added noise to the investigation.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by the fictional threat actor group 'ShadowHook', which targeted a medium-sized energy company, 'VoltGrid Inc.', to exfiltrate sensitive data and establish persistent access. The campaign employed a multi-vector approach, blending physical and digital tactics, including USB drops, phishing, and network manipulation, to compromise systems and evade detection. VoltGrid Inc. is a fictional utility provider based in Chicago, Illinois, with operations across the Midwest, specializing in smart grid technologies and renewable energy integration. The incident was detected during a routine security audit when anomalous network traffic patterns were flagged by a SIEM alert on June 15, 2024, at 14:30 UTC, originating from an internal workstation with hostname VG-WS-007.",
