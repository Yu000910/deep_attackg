    "clean_text": "On March 15, 2024, VoltGrid Solutions reported anomalous network traffic and performance degradation in their data center. Investigation revealed a passive Ethernet tap installed in the server room, indicating physical access by an adversary. Concurrently, multiple employees accessed a compromised industry news website, which served malicious JavaScript that downloaded a payload onto their systems. The payload, a DLL file, was executed by abusing the svchost.exe process to run as a system service, enabling persistence and network propagation. Logs from the MS-SQL server showed unauthorized use of the sp_addlinkedsrvlogin command to link a newly created administrative account to other servers, facilitating lateral movement. The adversary then employed grep -E to search the /proc filesystem for process memory containing password patterns, extracting credentials from running applications. Network analysis identified Smart Install queries sent to Cisco switches, resulting in the extraction of configuration files that revealed network topology and access controls. A monitoring script was discovered copying clipboard contents every 30 seconds, capturing sensitive data such as passwords and API keys. The malware established a backdoor using TeamViewer, providing interactive remote access to compromised workstations. Exfiltrated data, including email archives and network diagrams, was uploaded to a remote server via anonymous FTP, bypassing standard security protocols. Finally, the attackers leveraged unsecured cloud instance metadata APIs to deploy cryptocurrency mining software, hijacking computational resources and causing significant performance issues. Background checks revealed no prior physical security breaches at VoltGrid, and system logs indicated normal user activity prior to the incident, with no immediate correlation to the hardware addition.",
