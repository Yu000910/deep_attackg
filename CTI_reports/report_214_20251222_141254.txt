On October 15, 2023, a critical infrastructure organization reported anomalous network traffic and credential theft incidents. Investigation revealed a coordinated attack campaign, likely initiated through spearphishing emails containing malicious archive files [T1204.002] that, when opened, executed embedded Lua scripts [T1059.011] to download additional payloads while obfuscating commands [T1027.010] to evade detection. Concurrently, adversaries deployed a passive network tap [T1200] to capture unencrypted credentials from internal systems, leveraging this access to exploit unused AWS cloud regions [T1535] by rapidly deploying instances across availability zones for command-and-control (C2) operations. The malware, identified as 'BotnetX', used DNS queries [T1071.004] to communicate with C2 servers and connected to an unprotected Wi-Fi network [T1669] to exfiltrate sensitive data, while employing binary padding [T1027.001] by embedding legitimate open-source code to appear benign. Additionally, the malware harnessed network resources [T1496.002] for credential stuffing attacks, amplifying its impact on organizational bandwidth. System logs from affected endpoints showed unusual PowerShell activity unrelated to the campaign, and the organization's background in energy distribution was noted, though no direct correlation to the attack was established. The actors maintained persistence through registry modifications and scheduled tasks, with ongoing efforts to trace the source of the hardware additions.
