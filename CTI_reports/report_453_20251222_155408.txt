The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with a fictional, educational scenario based on observed TTPs. This report simulates an attack by the APT group DARKTIDE, which has been active since early 2024, focusing on organizations in the U.S. and Europe. Background checks indicate DARKTIDE likely operates from Eastern Europe, with motives centered on financial gain and data theft, though no real-world incidents are associated. System logs from a compromised financial firm show unusual network traffic spikes on port 443, but these were initially dismissed as benign activity during routine maintenance. In the initial access phase, DARKTIDE actors conducted vulnerability scanning [T1595.002] by querying server banners to identify web server versions and potential exploits, while simultaneously exploiting external remote services [T1133] through an open Docker daemon API to deploy malicious containers in Ubuntu environments. During execution, the adversary used Windows Command Shell [T1059.003] via Word document macros to execute malicious commands, and they employed content injection [T1659] to intercept and modify DNS queries through a compromised ISP channel, redirecting traffic to attacker-controlled servers. For exfiltration, DARKTIDE leveraged exfiltration over Bluetooth [T1011.001] by exploiting Bluetooth pairing protocol weaknesses to transfer stolen credentials to nearby devices, and they conducted application exhaustion flood [T1499.003] by automating thousands of user registration attempts to overwhelm databases and disrupt services. Additional noise includes internal memos from a healthcare provider noting increased phishing attempts, but these were unrelated to the campaign. Network administrators reported minor latency issues on VPN connections, which were resolved without incident. This scenario highlights the importance of monitoring for blended attacks and implementing robust security controls.
