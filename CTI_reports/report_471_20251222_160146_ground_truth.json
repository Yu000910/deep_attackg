The actors then gained initial access by leveraging default credentials for authenticating myWebMethods (WMS) and QLogic web management interfaces, as observed in historical FIN13 campaigns. Following this, they exploited Office vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0798 to execute malicious code on client systems, similar to XLoader tactics. For persistence, the adversary configured HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\explorer.exe to inject a backdoor that runs instead of the legitimate process. To evade detection, they employed polymorphic code in 'malware.exe' by modifying its import address table to bypass signature scanning, while also using bcdedit.exe to modify the boot configuration and disable security software in Safe Mode. System logs from the compromised environment show routine network scans, but no anomalies were flagged initially. The actors then conducted network share discovery using tools like ShimRat to enumerate connected drives on infected hosts, as part of lateral movement efforts.
