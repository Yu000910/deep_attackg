On October 15, 2023, EnerGrid Solutions, a fictional energy provider based in Texas with 500 employees, reported anomalous network activity to authorities. Initial analysis revealed that the adversary, likely operating as 'ShadowGale', conducted reconnaissance through open-source intelligence gathering, though no specific techniques were tagged in this phase. The actors then established operational infrastructure by renting a Virtual Private Server (VPS) from a European hosting provider using fake credentials [T1583.003], which they utilized to host malicious payloads on the Discord content delivery network [T1608.001]. Subsequently, they delivered spearphishing emails to EnerGrid employees, containing malicious links that redirected to the hosted malware [T1566.002]. Upon execution, the malware employed PowerShell scripts to download additional tools while simultaneously creating system services via systemctl to maintain persistence and execute cryptocurrency mining software [T1569.003]. The actors then performed discovery activities, using commands to check for peripheral devices plugged into infected hosts [T1120] and identify remote systems through net view to map the network [T1018]. For lateral movement and data exfiltration, they established encrypted SSH-based tunnels to transfer tools and execute remote commands [T1021.004], while staging collected file metadata in C:\Windows\Temp before encryption [T1074]. To evade detection, they employed obfuscation techniques by encrypting HTTP POST communications with XOR keys [T1001] and hid command-and-control infrastructure by retrieving non-existent webpages to send hidden commands via error messages [T1665]. Finally, after data exfiltration, they triggered immediate deletion of objects across multiple storage buckets using modified lifecycle policies [T1485.001]. Logs from EnerGrid's SIEM showed increased outbound traffic to unknown IPs, but no further action was taken as this is a training scenario.
