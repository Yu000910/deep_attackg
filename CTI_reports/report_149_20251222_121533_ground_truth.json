Crimson Serpent, a financially motivated APT group, has been observed targeting U.S. financial organizations since early 2024, leveraging external remote services such as VPNs and RDP to gain initial access while using PowerShell to download and execute malicious scripts that establish persistence by creating startup items in system directories. During the attack, the actors hijacked active RDP sessions using tools like tscon.exe to move laterally within the network and employed symmetric cryptography with CAST-128 encryption to obfuscate command-and-control traffic, while also modifying cloud compute infrastructure by deleting critical VM snapshots to erase forensic evidence and executing data destruction by overwriting master boot records to render systems unbootable. Background noise includes routine system logs showing failed login attempts from IP 192.168.1.100 and company details about the fictional target 'Global Finance Corp,' which operates across multiple regions with an outdated patch management system, though these elements are not directly related to the tagged techniques.",
