Background: The fictional APT group 'ShadowWeaver' has been observed targeting energy and manufacturing sectors since early 2024, with incidents reported across multiple regions. Initial analysis suggests the group aims to disrupt operations and exfiltrate sensitive data. The campaign involves a blend of digital and physical tactics, including the use of compromised CI/CD pipelines and USB-based hardware drops.

Attack Narrative:
- **Initial Access:** The actors likely conducted reconnaissance to identify vulnerable GitHub repositories, then compromised a GitHub Actions workflow [T1584.006] to automate malicious code execution in CI/CD pipelines, while simultaneously dropping multiple USB Rubber Ducky devices in high-traffic areas such as office lobbies and parking lots [T1200] to gain physical access to networks.
- **Execution:** Upon user interaction with the USB devices, a trojan displayed a deceptive 'Document Conversion Failed - Click to Retry' dialog that executed encoded commands when the user retried the operation [T1204.004], allowing the adversary to establish initial footholds.
- **Persistence:** To maintain access, the threat actor injected a backdoor payload into DNS queries [T1659], establishing persistent communication channels that evaded traditional network monitoring.
- **Lateral Movement:** The actors employed PowerShell scripts to upload PsExec.exe to multiple workstations [T1608.002], facilitating lateral movement across the network and enabling further compromise of critical systems.
- **Impact:** In the final stage, the group used an IP spoofing script to hide the true origin of DDoS traffic [T1498], launching network denial-of-service attacks that disrupted operational services and caused significant downtime.

Noise and Irrelevant Information: System logs from affected organizations showed routine authentication failures and scheduled maintenance events unrelated to the attack. Company background checks revealed no prior security incidents, and internal audits indicated compliance with standard cybersecurity frameworks. Additional network traffic analysis included benign HTTP requests to public APIs and routine backup processes, which did not correlate with malicious activity.

Mitigation Recommendations: Blue teams should implement strict access controls for CI/CD pipelines, conduct regular USB device audits, deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to monitor for unusual PowerShell activity, and enhance DNS filtering to detect payload injections. Training on social engineering awareness is also advised to reduce risks from deceptive user interfaces.
