On October 15, 2023, security analysts at a fictional mid-sized technology firm, 'TechGlobal Inc.', detected anomalous network traffic originating from a compromised marketing website. TechGlobal Inc., headquartered in San Francisco with 500 employees, specializes in cloud-based software solutions and maintains a hybrid IT environment with Windows servers for internal operations and Unix-based systems for development. Initial logs showed a spike in traffic to the company's public-facing blog, which had been recently updated with SEO-optimized content.

The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify vulnerable websites, then employed SEO poisoning [T1608.006] by embedding hidden keywords in white text on a white background within the compromised website's header section, redirecting users to malicious domains. Upon a user visiting the site, a drive-by download occurred, leading to the execution of a PowerShell script that downloaded a payload [T1105] and modified registry keys [T1112] for persistence. On a compromised Windows host, the adversary used Mimikatz's lsadump::sam command to extract local account credentials [T1078.003] and employed Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) [T1047] to gather information on installed antivirus products while simultaneously using LaZagne to obtain credentials from web browsers such as Google Chrome [T1555.003]. For lateral movement, the actors utilized Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) [T1021.001] enabled via Koadic to access other systems, and on Unix-based machines, they altered ~/.bash_profile [T1546.004] to establish persistence by running a backdoor script. During exfiltration, ransomware extracted SSH keys and configuration data from the system's configuration management repository [T1602], and the malware established an encrypted VPN tunnel [T1665] to hide C2 traffic from network monitoring tools. Post-incident analysis revealed additional noise in system logs, including routine backup failures and unrelated firewall alerts, which were not indicative of malicious activity.
