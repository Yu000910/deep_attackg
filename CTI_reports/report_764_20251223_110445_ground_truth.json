    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide insights into a fictional APT campaign for educational training. In this scenario, Crimson Shadow actors likely conduct reconnaissance by searching open technical databases to gather victim identity information, specifically targeting digital certificates to map organizational infrastructure. The attack began with a phishing campaign distributing emails containing password-protected ZIP files that utilized a custom archiving method to evade detection. Upon execution, the malware employed a Unix shell to download payloads and check system versions while simultaneously performing peripheral device discovery to identify connected hardware. The actors then leveraged process hollowing to inject malicious code into legitimate processes, enabling the deployment of remote access tools that established persistent backdoors. To facilitate data exfiltration, Crimson Shadow created a cloud instance to host command-and-control servers and used exfiltration over web services to transfer encrypted files off the network. Logs from the victim's SIEM showed unusual outbound traffic to IP addresses associated with known malicious domains, though initial alerts were dismissed as false positives due to high network noise. The organization, a mid-sized bank with operations across three states, reported no actual financial loss but noted increased security alerts during the simulated incident period.",
