    "clean_text": "CrimsonShadow, a fictional advanced persistent threat group, initiated a campaign against a mid-sized financial services company, 'SecureFin Corp.', based in New York with 500 employees and a focus on digital banking solutions. System logs from the corporate firewall showed unusual outbound traffic spikes on March 15, 2024, but initial scans flagged them as false positives related to routine software updates. The attack began with reconnaissance, where the actors created a counterfeit Instagram profile impersonating SecureFin's official account to gather customer information and simultaneously used automated tools to brute-force directories on the company's web servers. Following this, they planted a malicious USB device, disguised as a promotional giveaway, in the employee breakroom to lure curious staff into plugging it into corporate systems. Once initial access was achieved, the adversary employed a Unix shell script to execute payloads and modify system configurations while leveraging administrative privileges in the Google Admin console to add themselves as delegates to multiple corporate email accounts. For lateral movement, they used the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) protocol to remotely execute VBScript through Microsoft Office components and encoded command-and-control (C2) traffic with Base64 to evade network detection. Incident response teams noted that the attack was contained after 72 hours, with no actual data loss reported, as this was a training exercise. Background checks revealed that SecureFin had recently updated its antivirus software, but misconfigurations in email filtering allowed some phishing attempts to bypass initial defenses.",
