CrimsonViper likely conducted reconnaissance by purchasing technical data [T1597.002] from a commercial IP geolocation service to identify the physical locations of the target's servers, enabling more precise targeting. The actors then gained initial access by leveraging default credentials [T1078.001] for authenticating myWebMethods (WMS) and QLogic web management interfaces, as observed in historical FIN13 campaigns. Following this, they exploited Office vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0798 [T1203] to execute malicious code on client systems, similar to XLoader tactics. For persistence, the adversary configured HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\explorer.exe to inject a backdoor [T1546.012] that runs instead of the legitimate process. To evade detection, they employed polymorphic code [T1027.014] in 'malware.exe' by modifying its import address table to bypass signature scanning, while also using bcdedit.exe to modify the boot configuration and disable security software in Safe Mode [T1562.009]. System logs from the compromised environment show routine network scans, but no anomalies were flagged initially. The actors then conducted network share discovery [T1135] using tools like ShimRat to enumerate connected drives on infected hosts, as part of lateral movement efforts. Finally, they used remote desktop software [T1219.002] by running a legitimate TeamViewer application, similar to EVILNUM's TerraTV malware, to connect to compromised machines for command and control. The target organization, a mid-sized bank with operations in North America, reported no financial losses but experienced significant downtime during the incident response.
