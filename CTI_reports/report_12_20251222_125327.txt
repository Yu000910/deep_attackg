The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight a fictional Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaign for training purposes. This report is based on a simulated attack scenario designed to educate blue teams on detection and response strategies. CrimsonVector, a fictional threat actor, has been observed targeting organizations in the financial and technology sectors, leveraging cloud-based container environments to infiltrate networks and exfiltrate sensitive data. Initial reconnaissance likely involved scanning for exposed Docker registries and misconfigured Kubernetes clusters, though specific techniques are not detailed in this scenario. The attack began with the adversary gaining initial access through a compromised developer account, exploiting weak authentication mechanisms. Upon access, the actor executed Mimikatz.exe to dump credentials from the LSASS process [T1078.003], harvesting local account credentials for lateral movement. Concurrently, the attacker crafted a malicious Dockerfile that secretly installed credential harvesting tools during the container build phase [T1204.003], embedding backdoors into production images. To establish persistence, CrimsonVector registered a Windows shell script under the Registry key HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript [T1037.001], ensuring execution upon user logon. For data collection, the actor utilized LightNeuron, a fictional tool, to encrypt and store emails [T1560], archiving sensitive information. Command and control (C2) communications were conducted over TCP [T1095], bypassing traditional application-layer defenses. In a disruptive phase, the adversary modified the organization's main website to display fake news articles spreading misinformation [T1491.002], defacing external pages. Additionally, CrimsonVector killed several processes and services related to backups and security solutions [T1489], hindering recovery efforts. System logs from the affected environment show routine activities, such as scheduled backups and user login attempts, which are unrelated to the attack. The organization, a mid-sized fintech company, had recently migrated to a hybrid cloud infrastructure, increasing its attack surface. Blue teams should monitor for unusual container builds, registry modifications, and service disruptions, implementing network segmentation and multi-factor authentication to mitigate similar threats.
