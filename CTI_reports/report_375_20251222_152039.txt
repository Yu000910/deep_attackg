The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training insights into a fictional APT campaign. Crimson Viper actors likely conduct reconnaissance by monitoring social media platforms [T1593.001] and querying business directories [T1593] to gather organizational details, while also scanning FTP server banners to identify software versions [T1592.002]. During the initial access phase, the actors established wireless connections to enterprise Wi-Fi networks [T1669], exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE-2022-30190 for client execution [T1203] and using rundll32.exe to execute shellcode from compromised DLL files via ClickOnce [T1127.002]. For persistence, they modified Plist files to run scripts upon system events [T1647] and created scheduled tasks to execute malicious DLLs [T1546], while maintaining access through forged web cookies [T1606.001]. In the network phase, the malware abused DHCP protocol options to spoof DNS queries [T1557.003], redirecting traffic to malicious servers. Data collection involved staging files locally using cmd.exe to save metadata to temporary directories [T1074] and storing system files in working folders [T1074.001], with payloads accessed via dead drop resolvers [T1102.001]. Finally, exfiltration was conducted by uploading collected email archives to text storage sites using PowerShell scripts [T1567.003]. System logs from the targeted environment showed routine network traffic and user login attempts, but no anomalies were flagged initially, highlighting the need for enhanced monitoring of these TTPs.
