    "clean_text": "On October 15, 2023, GlobalTech Inc., a technology firm with operations in North America and Europe, reported suspicious activity across its network. Initial analysis revealed that the threat actor, 'Silent Echo', likely conducted reconnaissance by exploiting a vulnerable VoIP system to intercept executive meetings, gaining insights into internal processes. The attack began with the adversary sending a phishing email disguised as an invoice to an employee in the finance department, which included a malicious attachment named 'SecurityCheck.ps1', a credential-harvesting PowerShell script. Upon execution, this script facilitated initial access by deploying a web shell on a vulnerable web server, allowing persistent control. Concurrently, the actor used a compromised USB-to-Ethernet adapter to perform network reconnaissance when connected, mapping internal systems. Once inside, the threat actor employed AppleScript to modify system firewall rules and utilized SQL stored procedures via xp_cmdshell to download and execute additional payloads from a remote server. To expand their foothold, the group conducted internal spearphishing from within the compromised network, targeting other employees with tailored messages. Keylogging was implemented through a tool similar to PoisonIvy, capturing sensitive credentials. Data exfiltration occurred over non-standard ports, such as TCP 8080, with files being transferred to cloud storage using Rclone commands. Finally, as a destructive measure, the attackers exploited the ADMIN$ share to deploy a disk wipe payload, corrupting system files. Logs from GlobalTech's SIEM showed unusual outbound traffic patterns, but no prior alerts were triggered for the VoIP compromise.",
