The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide a fictional, educational overview of APT activity for blue team training purposes. The actors, designated as 'ShadowMimic', likely conduct reconnaissance by querying public DNS records to identify subdomains and understand organizational network segmentation [T1590.003] while simultaneously using malicious scripts to query the GetCredentialType API to identify corporate email addresses for credential harvesting [T1589.002]. In the initial access phase, the adversary hijacked unsecured IoT smart home devices to form a botnet for coordinated malicious activities [T1583.005] and injected malicious .js into ad network scripts to distribute malware to visitors via drive-by compromises [T1608.004]. System logs from a compromised web server show routine traffic spikes unrelated to this activity. The actors then exploited public-facing applications, conducting SQL injection attacks and leveraging vulnerabilities such as CVE-2019-19781 for Citrix and CVE-2020-0688 for MS Exchange [T1190], followed by using VBScript to execute malicious code [T1059.005] that spawned svchost.exe through the CreateProcess API to blend with legitimate system activity via parent PID spoofing [T1134.004]. The malware leveraged 'presentationhost.exe' to load and execute a malicious DLL payload through trusted developer utilities proxy execution [T1127] and modified the ROMMON image to establish persistent access to routers [T1542.004]. Background on the targeted organization, a fictional energy company, indicates no prior incidents. In the post-exploitation phase, malware running in a compromised container collected API access tokens from environment variables to steal application access tokens [T1528] and used SMBTouch, a vulnerability scanner, to determine whether targets were vulnerable to EternalBlue malware for network service discovery [T1046]. The malicious scripts then queried the administrative REST API using stolen authentication tokens [T1550.001] and communicated using custom TCP protocols for command and control [T1095]. Network monitoring tools recorded anomalous outbound connections during this phase.
