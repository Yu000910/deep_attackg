On October 15, 2023, CRIMSON SHADOW initiated a campaign against a fictional energy company, 'GridPower Inc.', by distributing spearphishing emails with malicious Word attachments [T1566.001] that, when opened, executed macros to download and run a Trojan horse named 'ThreatNeedle' via PowerShell [T1059]. Concurrently, the actors physically inserted USB drives containing 'documents.exe' into air-gapped networks to replicate malware [T1091] and used Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) [T1047] to query system information while establishing a Meterpreter shell [T1059] for remote access. To maintain persistence, they modified the Group Policy Client-Side Extension to load a malicious DLL during user authentication [T1037.003] and dropped a malicious dylib file named libssl.dylib into /usr/local/lib/ to hijack legitimate application loading [T1574.004]. In later stages, the actors replaced the monolithic kernel on an industrial controller with malicious firmware to disable security features [T1601] and used FTP protocols for command and control (C2) communication [T1071.002]. System logs from GridPower Inc. showed unusual network traffic spikes at 02:00 UTC, but initial alerts were dismissed as false positives due to routine maintenance schedules. The company, founded in 1995, reported no operational disruptions, though internal investigations revealed unauthorized access to SCADA systems.
