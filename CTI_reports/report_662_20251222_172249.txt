On 2023-10-15, security analysts at a fictional energy company, 'GridSecure Inc.', detected anomalous network traffic from a software update server. Investigation revealed that a threat actor, likely 'ShadowSupply', had compromised the software supply chain by replacing a legitimate compiled binary on the distribution server with a trojanized version containing backdoor functionality [T1195.002]. This malicious binary was distributed to multiple internal systems via automated updates, leading to initial infection. Upon execution, the malware abused Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to launch a PowerShell script for local code execution [T1559] and [T1559.002], specifically manipulating DDE protocol in Office documents to execute system commands on victim machines. The implant then employed setsockopt to set socket flags for detecting covert channel communications [T1205.002], while simultaneously modifying the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Netsh registry entry to execute a payload on system start via Netsh Helper DLL [T1546.007] and altering TCC.db to grant itself camera access permissions [T1548.006]. To maintain persistence and evade detection, the adversary executed a malicious DLL using a legitimate Microsoft-signed binary for proxy execution [T1216], including abuse of pubprn.vbs to run a remote VBScript that installed a backdoor [T1216.001]. System logs from 2023-10-16 showed increased PowerShell activity, unrelated to normal operations, as the actor used batch scripts to enumerate administrators and users in the domain [T1069.002] and employed FTP to transfer additional tools from an external system into the compromised environment [T1105]. Network monitoring detected anomalous traffic patterns, where the threat actor used ROMMONkit to create a covert channel that mirrored network communications for automated data extraction [T1020.001], and a script named 'log_cleaner.ps1' was found compressing and scheduling data transfer during nighttime hours [T1029]. Finally, on 2023-10-20, the malware executed the 'format' command to wipe the primary hard drive, rendering systems unusable [T1561]. GridSecure Inc. reported no financial impact, but recovery efforts are ongoing.
