    "clean_text": "FLORAHOX actors initiated their campaign by establishing a Facebook persona with a fabricated educational and professional background, specifically creating social media accounts to build credibility for phishing attempts. The malware author used signtool.exe to sign their malicious script with a forged certificate to evade detection, while simultaneously exploiting vulnerable routers to recruit additional network devices into the ORB. On compromised systems, the actors employed malicious JavaScript files to execute payloads and replaced the legitimate termsrv.dll with a malicious version to enable unauthorized remote connections. For discovery, the malware listed GPP files in bare format using 'dir /s *.xml /b' and queried %APPDATA%/Google/Chrome to retrieve cached network information and cookies. Data collection involved executing 'dir \\\\fileserver\\shared\\*.docx' to search for sensitive documents on a network share and using a compromised developer account to collect sensitive environment variables stored in GitHub organization secrets. Communication was secured using SSL and TLS for asymmetric cryptography, with the malware establishing a covert channel using HTRAN as an external proxy to mask command and control patterns in network traffic. Exfiltration was conducted by collecting sensitive documents using a PowerShell script named 'malicious.ps1' and uploading them to text storage sites. Finally, the actors encrypted files on targeted systems, appending them with the suffix .seth for impact. System logs from affected routers showed unusual traffic spikes, and background checks revealed the company had recently migrated to cloud services, though this was unrelated to the attack.",
