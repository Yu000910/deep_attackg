On October 15, 2023, APT-99 initiated a spearphishing campaign via Twitter, sharing a fake software update link that, when clicked, installed malware [T1566.003]. The malware leveraged SCCM's software distribution feature to execute PowerShell scripts on connected workstations [T1072], enabling the adversary to run 'net localgroup "Backup Operators" malicious_account /add' to gain backup privileges [T1098.007] while simultaneously using 'whoami' to gather user information [T1033]. Following this, APT-99 parsed the bash_history file to extract command line entries containing API keys [T1552.003] and accessed sensitive system configuration data from the centralized configuration management repository [T1602]. The actors then monitored broadcast traffic to find ARP requests, revealing network topology through ARP cache poisoning [T1557.002] and collected sensitive deployment procedures from the Confluence repository using the compromised user account [T1213.001]. To evade detection, APT-99 altered URI paths dynamically, impersonating legitimate protocols or services [T1001.003], and exploited a zero-day flaw in the database management system to trigger infinite loops that persistently degraded performance [T1499.004]. Logs from the affected systems showed increased CPU usage and network anomalies, but no actual data loss occurred in this training scenario. The organization, a fictional energy provider, had recently updated its firewall policies, which were not directly related to the attack. Analysis indicated that APT-99 likely operated from compromised infrastructure in Eastern Europe, though attribution remains uncertain for educational purposes.
