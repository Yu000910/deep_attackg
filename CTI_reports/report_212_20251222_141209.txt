On 2024-10-05, GlobalTech Solutions, a technology firm with offices in North America and Europe, detected anomalous activity in its VMware ESXi environment, leading to an investigation that uncovered a multi-stage intrusion. The attack began with reconnaissance, where actors likely scanned public-facing SSH servers [T1589], though no specific logs were captured for this phase. Initial access was achieved when the adversary brute-forced weak SSH credentials on a Linux development server, acquiring valid accounts [T1078]. System logs from server 'dev-linux-01' showed multiple failed login attempts from IP 203.0.113.45 prior to a successful connection at 14:32 UTC. Once inside, the actor executed commands via the hypervisor CLI to disable the firewall on ESXi host 'esx-host-03' using 'esxcli network firewall set --enabled false' [T1059.012], facilitating unrestricted lateral movement. The attacker then compromised the McAfee ePO server 'ePO-server-01' by exploiting a known vulnerability, using it to distribute a malicious PowerShell script as a software deployment task [T1072] to Windows endpoints in the finance department. To escalate privileges, a script named 'ImpersonateLoggedOnUser.exe' was deployed, which impersonated an active domain administrator session [T1134.001] and leveraged Pass-the-Hash techniques [T1550] to authenticate to remote systems without plaintext passwords. Enumeration activities included running 'net localgroup administrators' on compromised machines [T1069.001] to identify high-value targets. Lateral movement continued with exploitation of Microsoft Excel's DCOM interface [T1021.003] to execute code on remote workstations, while the actor accessed Microsoft Dynamics 365 to export customer contact lists [T1213.004] for potential phishing campaigns. Command and control was obfuscated using fast flux DNS [T1568.001] to rotate IP addresses and Tor routing [T1665] to hide infrastructure. Finally, a malicious PowerShell script systematically collected sensitive contract documents from shared network drives [T1020], with exfiltration traffic masked as normal HTTPS requests to cloud storage domains. Incident responders noted that the attack was contained after isolating affected systems, but residual artifacts may persist in log files.
