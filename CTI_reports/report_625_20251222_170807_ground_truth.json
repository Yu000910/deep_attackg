    "clean_text": "APT-99 likely conducted reconnaissance on software vendors, leading to the compromise of a third-party update server used by the victim organization, which delivered a malicious payload through a legitimate software update. Upon execution, the adversary employed Python scripts to load additional modules while simultaneously querying the Windows registry for cached domain credentials and using network sniffing tools to intercept unencrypted authentication traffic over the corporate network. The malware then performed peripheral device discovery to identify external drives and printers for potential ransomware operations, while also leveraging cloud storage object discovery via Azure APIs to enumerate blob containers in the victim's cloud environment. To evade detection, the actors embedded junk data in network communications to mimic legitimate DNS traffic. System logs from the affected server, 'SRV-APP01', showed unusual outbound connections to IP 192.0.2.100 on port 443, but no alerts were triggered by the existing IDS rules at the time.",
