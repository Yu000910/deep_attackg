    "clean_text": "On October 15, 2023, security personnel at a fictional university, Redwood University, discovered anomalous activity across multiple systems. The university, known for its research in cybersecurity and biotechnology, maintains a network of 5,000 endpoints with mixed Windows and Linux environments. Initial logs from the campus security office indicated unauthorized USB devices found in student lounges and faculty offices, prompting an investigation. APT-FICT likely conducted open-source reconnaissance to identify high-value targets within the university, focusing on departments with sensitive research data.\n\nThe attack began with hardware additions, where the threat actors dropped multiple USB Rubber Ducky devices disguised as promotional items and lost drives across the campus. When inserted by unsuspecting users, these devices executed scripts that harvested saved credentials from Windows Credential Manager for local account takeover. The infection script then employed Windows Management Instrumentation to execute discovery commands and determine command-and-control (C2) infrastructure while utilizing decoy domains to circumvent sandbox analysis. Subsequently, the malware leveraged Distributed Component Object Model to remotely trigger malicious macros in Microsoft Access databases and used Windows Remote Management via winrm to deploy additional payloads across enterprise systems. Network traffic analysis revealed C2 communications over HTTP on a non-standard port, TCP 46769, and exfiltration of stolen research data to various cloud storage providers. System logs from affected endpoints showed increased PowerShell activity and registry modifications, though some entries were unrelated to the incident, such as routine software updates and user login attempts from authorized devices.",
