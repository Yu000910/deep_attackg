The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to detail a fictional campaign by threat actor 'ShadowRecruit,' active since early 2024. This report is for educational purposes to train blue teams on identifying and mitigating advanced threats. The actor primarily targets mid-sized financial institutions in North America, leveraging a combination of open-source intelligence and custom tools. Initial analysis suggests the campaign aims to steal proprietary trading algorithms and customer data. System logs from a simulated victim, 'FinSecure Corp,' show anomalous network traffic beginning on March 15, 2024, with multiple failed login attempts from IP addresses associated with commercial VPN services, though these were unrelated to the main attack vector and likely noise from automated scanners.

The campaign begins with reconnaissance, where the attacker generated a Facebook persona posing as a recruiter to gather intelligence on employees and infrastructure [T1585]. This persona was used to send phishing emails with malicious links, though these attempts were blocked by email filters and did not lead to compromise. Following this, the actor employed 'fuzz_tool.exe' to systematically test for memory corruption bugs in a vulnerable web application, developing custom exploits [T1587.004] that were later deployed via a fake corporate VPN portal dropped to intercept authentication tokens and passwords [T1557.004]. Initial access was achieved when an employee connected to this evil twin portal, allowing the adversary to use Tor and a variety of commercial VPN services to route brute force authentication attempts [T1133] into the corporate network, bypassing perimeter defenses.

Upon gaining access, execution involved malware that utilized LoadLibraryEx to load a rogue DLL that established persistence on the system [T1129], while simultaneously employing PowerShell to modify registry keys and deploy additional payloads. The actor then exploited path interception opportunities in the PATH environment variable [T1574.007] to escalate privileges, leveraging tools like PowerSploit to discover vulnerable directories. For further execution, a malicious browser extension was used to inject payload.dll into the browsing session [T1185], enabling dynamic-link library injection into `rundll32.exe` [T1055.001] to maintain stealth and execute commands. Additionally, the malware exploited SCCM to execute a command that established persistence on all corporate devices [T1072], ensuring widespread compromise across the network.

Persistence and exfiltration were achieved through multiple mechanisms. The actor set auto-forward rules on victim's email accounts [T1114.003] to capture sensitive communications, while using HTRAN to encrypt and redirect C2 traffic through external proxies [T1090.002], making detection more difficult. Throughout the campaign, system logs showed routine backup processes and user login events, which were unrelated to the attack and served as noise to obscure malicious activities. The combination of these techniques allowed 'ShadowRecruit' to maintain long-term access and exfiltrate data over several weeks before detection.
