APT-99, a fictional advanced persistent threat group, has been observed conducting a sophisticated campaign against hybrid environments, combining on-premises domain and cloud account compromises. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify high-value targets, though initial access vectors in this scenario are unspecified. Upon gaining a foothold, APT-99 uses stolen domain admin credentials [T1078.002] to move laterally within the victim's on-premises network while simultaneously accessing Microsoft M365 cloud environments with compromised cloud accounts [T1078.004] to exfiltrate sensitive data. To maintain persistence, the adversary employs PowerShell to create scheduled tasks [T1053.005] on critical hosts and modifies registry keys [T1112] to ensure execution upon system startup. During execution, APT-99 performs system language discovery [T1614.001] by querying keyboard layouts via the GetKeyboardLayoutList API; if a match is found with a hardcoded list, the malware sleeps for 300 seconds and exits without encrypting files, evading detection in specific regions. For lateral movement, the group compromises software deployment tools like McAfee ePO [T1072] to distribute malicious payloads as legitimate software updates across the network. Additionally, APT-99 establishes protocol tunneling [T1572] using tools like Plink to tunnel RDP over SSH, bypassing network security controls for stealthy command and control. In a parallel effort, malicious scripts within the compromised infrastructure search for Twilio API documentation and endpoints [T1496.003] to potentially conduct SMS pumping attacks, though no actual SMS activity was confirmed in this simulation. System logs from a fictional company, GlobalTech Inc., show anomalous login attempts from unfamiliar IP addresses, but these were unrelated to the core attack chain and served as noise for training. Background checks revealed that GlobalTech Inc. recently migrated to a hybrid cloud model, increasing its attack surface, but this information is provided for context only and not tagged as part of the kill chain.
