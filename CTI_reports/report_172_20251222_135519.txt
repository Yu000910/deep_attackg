The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign dubbed 'ShadowVendor.' This exercise simulates an attack on 'GlobalTech Industries,' a company specializing in industrial automation with annual revenue of $500 million and offices in New York and Tokyo. Initial reconnaissance involved extracting supplier details from the victim's 'Vendors' webpage [T1591.002] while simultaneously establishing a fake professional networking profile to harvest corporate contacts [T1598.001]. System logs from April 15, 2024, show no unusual activity during this phase, but subsequent scanning using nmap.exe for TCP SYN sweeps on the IP range 192.168.1.0/24 was detected [T1595]. The actors then gained access via a compromised corporate VPN, exploiting weak authentication protocols [T1133], and used Windows Command Shell [T1059.003] to execute a .bat script that downloaded a backdoor from a compromised GitHub repository [T1584.006], which installed a fraudulent SSL certificate at C:\ProgramData\cert.pem for man-in-the-middle operations [T1608.003]. Persistence was maintained by executing 'code.exe' as an IDE extension [T1176.002], and the malware employed a Domain Generation Algorithm [T1568.002] for command and control communications while using libpcap to sniff network traffic for port knocking [T1205.001]. Credential theft involved configuring AWS Traffic Mirroring to capture unencrypted credentials [T1040] and using Pass-the-Hash techniques to authenticate to the Windows domain controller [T1550]. Finally, the botnet launched a network denial-of-service attack by sending millions of UDP packets to random firewall ports [T1498], though internal monitoring showed minimal disruption due to simulated defenses. This scenario is purely educational, with all data fabricated for blue team training purposes.
