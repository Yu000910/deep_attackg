CRIMSON TIDE, a suspected state-sponsored actor, has been observed targeting critical infrastructure entities, including energy and telecommunications providers, in a coordinated campaign since early 2024. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance on third-party vendors [T1598.003] to exploit trusted relationships [T1199], such as with DNS registrars, to gain initial access to primary targets. For example, in one incident, a malicious insider at a partner company deployed a passive network tap [T1200] to intercept authentication credentials from unencrypted traffic, which were then used to compromise target networks. Upon access, the adversary employed cloud CLI commands [T1059.009] to remotely install cryptocurrency mining software on compromised virtual machines, while simultaneously creating a PowerShell script in the Windows startup directory [T1037] to establish persistence and using a WMI event subscription [T1546.003] to maintain long-term access. On macOS systems, they modified plist files [T1647] to ensure malicious applications run at every login. To understand the environment, the actors executed the gpresult command [T1615] to discover Group Policy details and used time-based delays [T1497.003], such as 'sleep.exe 120', to evade automated analysis. For credential theft, they hooked NetUserGetInfo API calls [T1056.004] to harvest user account information and passwords, and they utilized dead drop resolvers [T1102.001] to retrieve configurations from public blog sites. In later stages, CRIMSON TIDE programmatically abused AWS SNS [T1496.004] to send high-frequency notifications, causing regional service degradation, and hijacked bandwidth [T1496.002] by redirecting outbound traffic through compromised residential proxies. System logs from affected entities show increased CPU usage on cloud instances and anomalous network flows, but no actual data exfiltration was confirmed in this training scenario. Background checks on the actors suggest ties to fictional regions, but attribution remains inconclusive for educational purposes.
