    "clean_text": "APT-99, a fictional advanced persistent threat group, likely conducted reconnaissance by searching a private threat intelligence portal for employee email addresses and analyzing public DNS records to map subdomains and IP addresses. Initial access was achieved by exploiting the Guest account, which was enabled by default on the victim's Windows servers. Once inside, the adversary employed a Visual Basic script placed in the Startup folder to deploy Smoke Loader, which then abused Windows Dynamic Data Exchange for inter-process communication to execute malicious commands and ran a PowerShell script, host_info.ps1, to collect system information such as hostname, IP address, and installed software. In the final stage, the malware deployed Hermes ransomware to encrypt files using AES256 encryption, causing operational disruption. Logs from the victim's SIEM showed unusual login attempts from IP 192.168.1.100 at 03:00 UTC, but no alerts were triggered due to misconfigured thresholds. The company, a mid-sized bank, had recently migrated to cloud infrastructure, which may have introduced vulnerabilities in access controls.",

Based on analysis of incident response data from a fictional victim, the campaign involves reconnaissance, initial access via default accounts, execution through Visual Basic scripts, and data encryption with ransomware. The advisory provides indicators of compromise (IoCs) and mitigation strategies for blue team training.",
