On October 15, 2023, GlobalTech Solutions, a fictional multinational technology firm with annual revenue of $5 billion and 10,000 employees, reported anomalous network activity originating from their internal development servers. Initial logs showed unusual outbound traffic to IP address 203.0.113.45, which was later attributed to a command-and-control (C2) server. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] prior to the attack, though no specific indicators were captured in this phase.

**Initial Access:** The threat actor compromised the software update mechanism by replacing the authentic compiled release with a malicious version on the official download portal, exploiting a vulnerability in the build pipeline to gain initial foothold [T1195.002]. This allowed them to deploy a backdoor disguised as a legitimate software update, which was downloaded by unsuspecting users at GlobalTech.

**Execution:** Upon execution, the malware employed PowerShell [T1059.001] to actively download additional payloads [T1105] while simultaneously modifying registry keys [T1112] to establish persistence. The actor then used the hypervisor command-line interface to execute 'esxcli software vib install -v /tmp/malicious.vib', installing a malicious VIB package on virtualized infrastructure to evade detection and maintain access [T1059.012].

**Persistence and Privilege Escalation:** The attacker used Mimikatz.exe to extract password hashes from the LSASS process memory, leveraging these credentials to move laterally across the network and escalate privileges by abusing alternate authentication material [T1550]. This was combined with abusing Visual Studio Code's debugging capabilities to create a persistent backdoor connection, enabling continuous access through IDE tunneling [T1219.001].

**Collection and Exfiltration:** The actor conducted data collection by using 'dir /s *.pdf' to search for PDF documents on connected USB drives, targeting sensitive intellectual property stored on removable media [T1025]. Exfiltrated data was obfuscated using Base64 encoding to evade network security controls, with Cobian RAT employing this standard encoding method for C2 communications [T1132.001]. Network logs indicated data transfers occurred during off-peak hours, with an average volume of 2 GB per session.

**Impact:** To disrupt operations, the adversary executed an ACK flood script on the mail server, overwhelming its processing capacity and causing a denial-of-service condition that lasted approximately 4 hours, impacting email services for 500 users [T1499.001]. This was part of a broader strategy to create distractions and hinder incident response efforts.

**Additional Context:** GlobalTech's security team noted that the attack coincided with a scheduled system maintenance window, suggesting the actors may have monitored internal communications. No ransom demands were made, indicating espionage as the primary motive. The company has since implemented enhanced software supply chain controls and network segmentation, with recovery costs estimated at $200,000.
