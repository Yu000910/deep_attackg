The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide a fictional, educational overview of APT activity for blue team training. The 'CloudPhantom' actors initiated their campaign by exploiting an open Wi-Fi network to establish initial network access [T1669] while simultaneously conducting reconnaissance on cloud infrastructure. They then altered the continuous integration server configuration to deploy malware-laden software updates to customers, compromising the supply chain [T1195]. To obfuscate their activities, the actors exploited Cloudflare Workers to create temporary redirects to malicious domains [T1584.007] and used cryptcat binaries to encrypt their traffic, establishing an encrypted channel [T1573]. Upon execution, the malware employed the Windows Command Shell [T1059.003] to issue commands via cmd.exe and enable SMBv1 during execution, performing a downgrade attack [T1562.010]. For persistence, ransomware created a hidden Outlook form with mechanisms in the default forms folder [T1137.003]. Lateral movement was achieved using Remote Desktop Protocol to access systems in the victim environment [T1021.001], and the malware queried the Microsoft Teams API to collect user credentials and authentication tokens from messaging applications [T1213.005]. System logs from the victim's network showed routine traffic spikes, but no alerts were triggered during the initial phases. The company, a fictional energy provider, reported unusual network latency and unauthorized access attempts from external IPs, though these were initially dismissed as false positives. Further investigation revealed encrypted payloads in temporary directories and modified registry keys, indicating a sophisticated multi-stage attack.
