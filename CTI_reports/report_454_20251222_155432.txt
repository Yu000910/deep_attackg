The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight a fictional APT campaign, 'ShadowVeil,' designed for blue team training. This report outlines a realistic attack scenario based on observed techniques in simulated exercises. Initial reconnaissance involved actors conducting a drive-by download that exploited a heap overflow in the browser to access and transmit host configuration information [T1592], while simultaneously querying public data breach repositories to find compromised credentials [T1586]. The attack began with spearphishing emails containing malicious Excel attachments [T1566.001], which, when opened, executed VBA macros to display a dialog box and collect victim credentials [T1059.005]. Upon execution, the malware placed a trojanized dylib in a writable directory with higher search precedence to hijack legitimate processes [T1574.004] and injected malicious.dll into the memory space of a running browser process using extra window memory injection to evade detection [T1055.011]. System checks were performed to determine if the malware was running in a sandbox environment by verifying the hard drive size; if detected, it would delete itself by overwriting malware scripts with the contents of 'License.txt' and exiting [T1497.001]. After establishing persistence, the actors used pass the hash techniques on compromised machines with x64 versions to move laterally [T1550.002] and employed metaMain to download additional tools onto compromised systems [T1105]. Communications with the command-and-control (C2) server were encrypted using AES in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode padded with PKCS5 for symmetric cryptography [T1573.001]. Data exfiltration was conducted in small, inconspicuous chunks via scheduled transfers using PowerShell scripts [T1029], and proprietary source code was written to a removable USB drive for exfiltration over physical medium [T1052]. Logs from the affected systems showed routine network traffic spikes during off-hours, unrelated to the attack, and the company's background includes a recent merger with a smaller fintech firm, which expanded its digital footprint. No actual data loss occurred in this training scenario.
