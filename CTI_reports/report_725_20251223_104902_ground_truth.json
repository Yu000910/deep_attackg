    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with a realistic training scenario based on fictional APT activity. The actors, designated as 'ShadowVeil', likely conduct reconnaissance by gathering passive DNS information from public sources and automatically searching for sitemap.xml files on victim-owned websites to map network infrastructure. Initial access was achieved through a compromised software supply chain, where malware similar to SUNSPOT was inserted into a third-party IT management tool's build process, allowing deployment of a backdoor. Once inside, the actors used password spraying tools against SSH accounts to capture domain admin credentials, enabling lateral movement. System logs from the target environment, 'Acme Corp', showed unusual login attempts from IP addresses in Eastern Europe, though these were later determined to be spoofed. The adversary then employed ESXi administration commands to execute malicious payloads on virtual machines while simultaneously modifying Launch Daemon plist files on macOS systems to ensure persistence. In cloud environments, roles were altered to include Global Administrator privileges, and peripheral devices were discovered using tools that scanned for USB drives. To evade detection, the malware performed anti-analysis checks and used symmetric cryptography with XOR-based algorithms to encrypt communications, while network sniffing intercepted unencrypted FTP credentials on port 21. Background information on Acme Corp indicates it is a mid-sized manufacturer with no prior major breaches, but this incident highlights gaps in their security posture. The campaign demonstrates a multi-stage approach blending reconnaissance, exploitation, and evasion techniques.",
