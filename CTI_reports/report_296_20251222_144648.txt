The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in the fictional 'ShadowTempo' campaign. This report is for training purposes only and does not describe real-world incidents. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance by querying the victim's careers page to identify hiring surge periods [T1591.003] and scraping the corporate blog to collect employee names for personalized phishing emails [T1589.003]. Initial access was achieved through a drive-by compromise [T1189] where a compromised vendor website delivered malicious payloads to unsuspecting users. Subsequently, the adversary modified USB firmware to bypass security controls and deploy malware as part of a hardware supply chain compromise [T1195.003]. On Linux systems, the threat actor ran 'systemctl start data-exfiltration.service' to initiate the data theft process [T1569.003], while on macOS, they dropped a malicious plist file named 'com.apple.update.plist' into ~/Library/LaunchAgents to establish persistence [T1543.001]. Execution flow was hijacked by manipulating cryptbase.dll within migwiz.exe to escalate privileges and bypass UAC controls [T1574]. Network communications were obfuscated using a multi-hop proxy [T1090.003] to relay encrypted traffic through rented virtual private servers, masking the actor's location. Finally, data was encrypted for impact using a variant of BlackCat ransomware targeting VMWare ESXi servers [T1486], causing operational disruption. System logs from the victim's environment showed anomalous network spikes and failed login attempts, though these were unrelated to the core attack chain. The company, a mid-sized tech firm with offices in multiple regions, reported no actual financial loss from this simulated exercise.
