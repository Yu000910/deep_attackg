    "clean_text": "APT-EDU-01 initiated the campaign by conducting spear-phishing voice calls to employees, directing them to download a remote access trojan disguised as a document viewer from a compromised website. Upon execution, the malware used schtasks.exe to schedule recurring tasks for credential harvesting and modified registry keys to enable malicious screensaver execution after idle periods, while simultaneously clearing Windows Event Log entries to obscure initial compromise traces. The actors then employed Rubeus to forge silver tickets for lateral movement and parsed Slack Workflow JSON files to harvest unsecured OAuth tokens from chat messages. Additionally, a JavaScript keylogger was deployed on the employee self-service portal to capture login credentials, and the malware scanned GitHub commit histories for exposed .env files in code repositories to collect sensitive environment variables. To facilitate data exfiltration, the malware captured and replaced Bitcoin wallet data in the clipboard and used HTTPS for encrypted command and control with bidirectional communication via OneDrive. System logs from the compromised host, such as 'Event ID 4688: A new process has been created' and network traffic to external IPs like 192.0.2.1, were observed but are unrelated to the tagged techniques. The company, a mid-sized financial services firm with 500 employees, reported unusual network slowdowns and unauthorized access attempts on internal portals, though these details serve as background noise for training purposes.",
