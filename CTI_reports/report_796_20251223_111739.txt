The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide details on a simulated APT campaign, designated 'SHADOW_ECHO', observed targeting various enterprise sectors. This fictional scenario is designed for educational purposes to train defensive teams in identifying and mitigating sophisticated threats.

Background: SHADOW_ECHO is a fictional threat actor believed to operate with objectives centered on intellectual property theft and credential harvesting. The campaign leverages common vulnerabilities in web applications and exploits human behavior through malicious online advertisements. Initial analysis indicates that the actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify potential targets, though specific techniques are not detailed in this scenario. The attack begins with a drive-by compromise [T1189], where victims are redirected to malicious sites via online advertising networks, leading to the deployment of malware without user interaction. Upon infection, the adversary establishes initial access by deploying a web shell on a vulnerable web server [T1650], allowing remote command execution. To maintain persistence, the malware creates scheduled tasks [T1053.005] that execute malicious scripts at regular intervals, while also modifying registry keys to ensure survival across reboots. For command and control (C2), the actors leverage Oracle Cloud's always-free compute instances to set up persistent servers [T1583.004], enabling reliable communication channels. The malware is configured to automatically connect to any open Wi-Fi network named 'Free_WiFi' [T1669] to facilitate data exfiltration and evade network monitoring. Data collection involves executing commands like 'findstr /s "password" \\server\data\*.txt' to harvest credentials from network shared drives [T1039] and extracting Active Directory configuration data from domain controllers [T1602] to map the network environment. For stealthy communication, the malware employs port knocking [T1205.001] by sending raw socket traffic to bypass standard port-based detection mechanisms. System logs from affected servers show unusual outbound connections to cloud IP addresses, but no direct correlation to the malware was initially flagged. The company, a mid-sized manufacturing firm, reported no prior incidents, but network traffic analysis revealed anomalous patterns during off-hours. This campaign underscores the importance of monitoring for unusual scheduled tasks, web shell activity, and unauthorized cloud communications.
