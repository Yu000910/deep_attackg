    "clean_text": "APT-FICT likely conducted initial reconnaissance by deploying a fake login page via phishing emails, which captured victim IP addresses when accessed. Following this, the actors employed spearphishing voice calls to persuade a user into downloading and executing a malicious TeamViewer executable, which facilitated remote access. Once inside the network, the adversary utilized the vSphere Web Services SDK to execute arbitrary commands on compromised guest VMs while simultaneously conducting ARP spoofing to intercept unencrypted credentials transmitted over the local network. To maintain persistence, they modified the Unix shell configuration file /etc/profile to automatically download and execute additional payloads upon user login. For data exfiltration, the actors compressed collected files using RAR utilities and established protocol tunneling through SSH dynamic port forwarding to route traffic via an external proxy, bypassing network filters. Finally, they leveraged a compromised device to connect to a nearby cellular network, transmitting the archived data over this alternative medium. Throughout the incident, system logs from the ESXi host showed unusual spikes in CPU usage, and the organization's background as a mid-sized tech firm with limited security monitoring contributed to delayed detection.",
