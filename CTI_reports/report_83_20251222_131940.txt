The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on simulated malicious activity attributed to the fictional threat actor ShadowGale, targeting energy sector entities in North America. This campaign, active since early 2024, aims to disrupt operations and steal intellectual property. Initial analysis indicates the actors likely conduct reconnaissance on target networks by utilizing wevtutil.exe to extract hardware-related event logs from compromised hosts [T1592.001], while simultaneously injecting malicious content into DNS and HTTP replies to redirect specifically-targeted victims to a fake Windows Update page for malware delivery [T1659]. Upon gaining access, the adversary employed Unix shell commands [T1059.004] to execute malicious applications and leveraged sudo -l to list allowed commands without password prompts for privilege escalation [T1548.003], followed by hijacking remote service sessions to disable Windows Defender using PowerShell commands [T1563]. During the persistence phase, the actors monitored for OWA authentication requests to log credentials via a web portal capture [T1056.003] and executed a fake DHCP service to intercept and log all DHCP discover requests [T1557.003]. Data collection involved uploading local files from compromised systems [T1005] and using Pastebin and Google Storage to host operational content [T1102]. Exfiltration was conducted over web services, with Cloudflare services utilized for data transfer [T1567]. Finally, the campaign included destructive actions, where a malicious script filled the entire storage volume with pseudorandom bytes to render files unrecoverable [T1561.001]. Logs from affected systems show increased network traffic and unauthorized access attempts, though some entries appear benign or unrelated to the attack. The targeted organization, 'EnergyGrid Inc.', reported no operational impact due to early detection by internal security teams. This activity underscores the need for robust monitoring and incident response protocols in critical infrastructure sectors.
