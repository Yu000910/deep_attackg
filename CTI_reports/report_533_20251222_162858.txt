On 2024-07-15, AlphaCorp Global's Security Operations Center (SOC) detected anomalous activity originating from their public-facing FortiGate firewall, which was running an outdated firmware version 6.4.5. Initial logs showed multiple failed login attempts from IP 192.0.2.100, followed by a successful exploit that deployed a backdoor payload [T1190]. The adversary then utilized AppleScript [T1059.002] to execute malicious commands via `osascript` in a Launch Agent .plist file, while simultaneously writing an AutoIt script [T1059.010] to inject code into legitimate processes like `svchost.exe` for evasion. System administrators noted unusual registry modifications in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{ABCDEF12-3456-7890-ABCDEF123456}\InprocServer32, indicating Component Object Model hijacking [T1546.015]. A subsequent scan revealed a DLL file named `credharvest.dll` in the Windows temp folder, consistent with a Password Filter DLL attack [T1556.002]. The malware also captured clipboard data [T1115], including copied passwords and sensitive text snippets. Exfiltration activities involved collecting database snapshots from an improperly configured Amazon S3 bucket [T1530] and using SSH over non-standard port 2222 for command and control [T1071]. Additionally, the actor employed GUI input capture [T1056.002] via a counterfeit iCloud login window to harvest Apple IDs, and transferred intellectual property files over an open WiFi access point [T1011]. Finally, the exploit kit injected 'evil.ps1' to alter system error message displays, resulting in defacement [T1491]. AlphaCorp's incident response team contained the threat by isolating affected systems and applying patches, with no real data loss reported in this training scenario.
