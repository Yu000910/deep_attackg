    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with a realistic training scenario based on fictional APT activity attributed to the threat group HEXANE. This report outlines a multi-stage attack campaign targeting a fictional energy sector organization, 'GridSecure Inc.', with irrelevant background details such as the company's recent merger with a regional utility provider and routine system logs showing normal network traffic spikes during off-peak hours.\n\nInitial Access and Reconnaissance: The actors initiated their campaign by conducting reconnaissance through a commercial threat intelligence provider to collect detailed network diagrams of GridSecure Inc., followed by a spearphishing campaign that exploited EvilProxy to intercept authentication tokens from targeted employees while simultaneously using spoofed password reset requests to harvest organizational account credentials. System logs from the corporate email server showed an increase in flagged spam messages, though many were unrelated marketing emails.\n\nExecution and Persistence: Upon gaining access, the adversaries employed valid accounts to deploy acquired and customized open-source tools, including Mimikatz for credential dumping and VNC remote access software, while using Windows Task Scheduler to execute malicious components across the network and editing service configurations to ensure automatic startup for persistent access. Background information: GridSecure Inc.'s IT department had recently completed a patch management audit with no critical findings.\n\nPrivilege Escalation and Defense Evasion: The threat actors escalated privileges by adding the setuid flag to a binary for future elevation and maintained persistent control through a compromised Chrome extension that manipulated browsing sessions, with unrelated logs indicating routine browser updates from standard software repositories.\n\nCredential Access and Lateral Movement: HEXANE extracted credentials from web browsers using tools like BrowserGhost and exploited Software Deployment Tools such as SCCM to deploy malicious scripts across all domain-joined systems, while internal network scans showed normal DHCP lease renewals during this period.\n\nCommand and Control and Impact: To ensure resilience, the malware employed domain generation algorithms to reestablish command and control after network disruptions and exploited SSL/TLS session renegotiation vulnerabilities to create resource exhaustion floods on target systems, with additional noise from routine backup processes running on unaffected servers.",

The actors leveraged valid accounts [T1078] to deploy customized open-source tools like Mimikatz and VNC [T1588.002], establishing persistence through Windows Task Scheduler [T1053.005] and modifying service configurations to automatic startup [T1668]. They maintained control via compromised Chrome extensions [T1176] and exploited SCCM for lateral movement [T1072], while using domain generation algorithms [T1568.002] and SSL/TLS session renegotiation vulnerabilities [T1499.002] for resilience and denial-of-service. The campaign included credential harvesting from web browsers [T1555.003] and privilege escalation via setuid binaries [T1548.001], highlighting multi-vector threats to enterprise networks.",
