On March 15, 2024, a financial institution reported suspicious emails from a Gmail account posing as HR, which were used to collect employee login credentials through spearphishing [T1598.001]. Analysis of network logs showed increased traffic to external domains, but no immediate alerts were triggered. The actors then compromised a developer account to upload a trojanized version of a widely used financial application to the official download server [T1195.002], while simultaneously injecting a malicious PowerShell script into the software's dependencies to enumerate and steal database connection strings [T1195.001]. System administrators noted unusual PowerShell activity but attributed it to routine maintenance. Following initial compromise, the adversaries exploited a malicious Excel document that leveraged the Excel COM interface to download and execute additional payloads [T1559.001], and they installed a cron job to periodically download and execute files from the command-and-control (C2) server [T1053.003]. Event logs from Linux servers indicated cron job executions at irregular intervals, though these were not flagged by standard monitoring tools. To establish persistence, a backdoor was deployed by executing a malicious DLL via the scheduled task mechanism [T1546], and the actors used masscan to discover kubelets and the kubelet API for identifying additional running containers [T1613]. Network scans revealed port 10250 access attempts, but these were logged as benign reconnaissance. For lateral movement, Pass-the-Hash was employed to authenticate to the Windows domain controller using compromised credential hashes [T1550], and PowerShell.exe was leveraged through WinRM to deploy payloads across the network [T1021.006]. Security teams observed WinRM sessions from unusual IP addresses but did not correlate them with earlier phishing events. To evade detection, malicious scripts utilized modified Base64 encoding with URL-safe characters to conceal C2 data [T1132.002], and fake Transport Layer Security (TLS) was used to communicate with the C2 server [T1001.003]. Finally, exfiltrated data, including customer records and financial data, was transferred to online file hosting sites such as Mega.co.nz [T1567]. The institution's data loss prevention system flagged large uploads but only after significant data had been exfiltrated.
