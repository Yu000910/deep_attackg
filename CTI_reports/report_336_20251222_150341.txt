On January 15, 2024, PowerGrid Solutions reported anomalous activity in their corporate email systems, with employees receiving emails from 'hr.powergrid@gmail.com' requesting password resets for internal portals, which the actors used to conduct spearphishing [T1598.001] while simultaneously scanning public databases [T1596.005] for exposed Docker daemons on the company's cloud infrastructure. Between January 20 and February 10, the actors leveraged stolen credentials [T1078] to access several employee email accounts, where they executed Lua scripts [T1059.011] to gather system information and network configurations, and abused the network device CLI [T1059.008] with commands like 'no cdp run' to disable detection mechanisms on Cisco routers. System logs from February 15 showed unusual DLL injections into credential management processes, as the attackers deployed a password filter DLL [T1556.002] to monitor input fields in applications like web browsers and VPN clients. By March 1, the actors had collected sensitive data, including browser cookies, which they encrypted using a custom XOR cipher [T1560.003] for archiving and exfiltrated through a multi-hop proxy network [T1090.003] consisting of Tor nodes to obscure their command-and-control traffic. Incident responders noted that the initial spearphishing campaign originated from IP addresses in Eastern Europe, but no definitive attribution has been made in this training scenario. PowerGrid Solutions' security team detected the activity during a routine audit of network device configurations, where they found disabled CDP settings and anomalous Lua process executions on Linux servers.
