    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide insights into a fictional threat actor, designated as 'Crimson Serpent', observed targeting energy and manufacturing sectors in a simulated training scenario. Analysis of network traffic from early 2024 revealed anomalous patterns, including increased DNS queries to suspicious domains, which prompted further investigation. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by gathering IP address ranges and searching business databases like RocketReach for targeted individual information while utilizing GetUserRealm API calls to collect domain federation configuration data. In the initial access phase, the adversary compromised the software supply chain by embedding malicious code into a legitimate, signed version of a popular utility tool, distributed via the official download site. Upon execution, the malware employed Windows Command Shell to run BAT scripts that forced authentication through a file://remote_address exploit, triggering PowerShell scripts to harvest LSASS memory for hashes. To evade detection, the malware obfuscated command and control (C2) traffic using base64 encoding for all outgoing communications. During the exfiltration phase, the malicious executable gathered network topology maps and infrastructure diagrams, exfiltrating them over an asymmetric encrypted non-C2 protocol and automatically copying sensitive documents to any connected USB drive. System logs from the affected environment showed routine backup processes running concurrently, with no immediate impact on operational systems, though this activity was part of the simulated attack chain. Background checks on the fictional company 'InfraCorp' revealed no prior incidents, but this scenario highlights the importance of monitoring for such techniques in real-world defenses.",
