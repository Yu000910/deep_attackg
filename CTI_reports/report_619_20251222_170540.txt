On 2023-10-15, a fictional incident response team at 'GlobalTech Corp', a mid-sized technology firm with offices in New York and London, reported suspicious activity following a series of phone calls from individuals claiming to be IT support. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify key personnel and system details, though this was not directly observed in logs. During the initial access phase, the adversary employed spearphishing voice calls [T1566.004] to impersonate legitimate IT staff, directing victims to download a remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool that allowed remote control of their systems. System logs from the affected Windows 10 endpoints showed unusual PowerShell executions at 14:30 UTC, but no immediate alerts were triggered. For persistence, the malware configured /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root [T1053.003] to run a backdoor script daily while simultaneously updating RoleBinding.yaml [T1098.006] in a Kubernetes cluster to bind a high-privilege role to a specific service account, ensuring continued access across containerized environments. The actors then bypassed User Account Control (UAC) by using the IFileOperation COM interface method [T1548] to elevate privileges and execute malicious commands, as noted in event logs with ID 4688. To expand their foothold, they employed the Azure Serial Console [T1021.008] to directly execute commands on an Azure VM through the Azure portal interface, while configuring HTRAN [T1090.002] to relay encrypted command-and-control (C2) traffic through compromised systems, obscuring their origin. Network traffic analysis revealed spikes in outbound connections to IP 192.0.2.1, but this was initially dismissed as backup activity. Finally, the malware activated a denial-of-service module [T1499] targeting critical endpoints, causing service disruptions that were logged as system crashes with error code 0x0000007E. The company's background includes a recent migration to Azure, which may have increased attack surface visibility. Incident responders noted that no data exfiltration was detected, suggesting the campaign focused on disruption and persistence.
