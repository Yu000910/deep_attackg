On April 15, 2024, a financial services company, 'SecureFin Corp,' reported anomalous activity across its hybrid IT infrastructure. The company, which handles sensitive client portfolios, operates Windows 10 workstations, macOS endpoints for creative teams, and Linux servers for database management. Initial investigation revealed that an employee inadvertently connected a compromised USB drive to a Windows workstation, triggering an altered Autorun.inf file that launched a hidden payload [T1091]. This payload, identified as a variant of 'jRAT,' then executed a multi-stage attack. On macOS systems, the adversary used the launchctl command to load a malicious plist file for persistence [T1569.001], while on Windows, they modified the Office registry key to load a malicious add-in at startup [T1137.002] and configured a compromised shortcut.lnk file to run malware.exe from a remote network share [T1547.009]. System logs from the Linux servers showed unusual cron job activity, where a CronJob was created to run a container that established reverse shell connections every 15 minutes [T1053.007], and the attacker employed 'find / -perm +4000' to locate files with the setuid bit set for potential privilege escalation [T1548.001]. During the execution phase, jRAT captured microphone recordings from compromised endpoints [T1123], and the malware used cryptcat binaries to encrypt command-and-control traffic [T1573] while proxying network communications through intermediary nodes [T1090]. For exfiltration, sensitive documents, including manipulated Excel databases where specific cells were altered to corrupt financial records [T1565.001], were uploaded to a Dropbox account controlled by the attacker [T1567.002]. The company's firewall logs indicated increased outbound traffic to cloud storage services, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to encrypted channels. This campaign highlights the need for enhanced monitoring of removable media, persistence mechanisms, and encrypted data flows in cross-platform environments.
