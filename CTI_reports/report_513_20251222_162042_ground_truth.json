    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory in response to observed activity by the APT group SHADOWPULSE, which has been actively targeting critical infrastructure in India since early 2024. Background analysis indicates that SHADOWPULSE operates with high sophistication, likely state-sponsored, and has previously been linked to espionage campaigns in the Asia-Pacific region. In this campaign, the actors initiated reconnaissance by gathering intelligence on target networks through open-source intelligence (OSINT) and social engineering, though no specific technique IDs are assigned to this phase as it involved non-technical methods.\n\nThe attack chain began with SHADOWPULSE compromising the hardware supply chain by injecting malicious firmware into USB charging stations distributed to corporate offices, which then infected connected devices when users plugged in their systems. Concurrently, the actors spoofed digital certificates to impersonate Microsoft updates, facilitating the delivery of malicious payloads that appeared legitimate to security software. To gain initial access, they exploited a trusted relationship by using stolen credentials from an Office 365 partner, which allowed them to obtain administrative control over cloud environments and deploy backdoors.\n\nOnce inside the network, SHADOWPULSE leveraged user execution through a phishing campaign where fake job offer attachments contained malicious documents that executed Empire payloads when users enabled content, leading to further compromise. The actors then conducted lateral movement by exploiting remote services using tools like Nmap to identify and target vulnerable services on internal systems, enabling them to escalate privileges and establish persistent access. For command and control (C2) communications, they employed symmetric cryptography with RC4 encryption to obfuscate all incoming and outgoing messages, making detection more challenging.\n\nData exfiltration was carried out through automated processes where malware collected sensitive files, such as malicious.exe, from compromised systems and transferred them to external servers. To evade network monitoring, SHADOWPULSE implemented data transfer size limits by exfiltrating data in small, 27-character chunks, reducing the likelihood of triggering alerts. In the final phase, the actors launched disruption attacks using reflection amplification by exploiting DNS amplification with spoofed source IPs to generate large responses, overwhelming target networks and causing service outages. System logs from affected organizations show anomalous network traffic spikes and unauthorized access attempts, though these are not tagged as they represent generic indicators rather than specific techniques. Defensive recommendations include enhancing supply chain security, implementing multi-factor authentication, and monitoring for unusual encryption patterns and exfiltration activities.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, designated as 'SHADOWPULSE,' targeting critical infrastructure sectors, with a focus on energy and telecommunications in India. The campaign leverages a multi-faceted attack chain involving hardware supply chain compromise, digital certificate spoofing, and exploitation of trusted relationships to achieve initial access, followed by lateral movement, data exfiltration, and disruption via reflection amplification attacks. Blue teams are advised to review defensive measures and indicators of compromise (IoCs) provided in the full report.",
