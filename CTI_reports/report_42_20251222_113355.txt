The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional APT campaign, 'ShadowVeil', observed targeting energy and manufacturing sectors. This report is for training purposes only, based on a simulated scenario. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance by actively scanning network segments [T1595] and performing iterative DNS queries to map organizational infrastructure [T1596.001]. Initial access was achieved through a phishing email with a malicious attachment, though this detail is not tagged as it falls outside the provided techniques. Upon execution, the malware employed Python scripts [T1059.006] to download and deploy a web shell while simultaneously replicating through removable media by infecting portable executable files on USB drives [T1091]. System logs from the compromised host show normal user activity during this phase, but these entries are irrelevant noise. For privilege escalation, the attackers leveraged world-writable files in /tmp to gain elevated execution [T1548.004] and spoofed security alerting by injecting a fake Windows Defender tray icon to create the illusion of active monitoring [T1562.011]. The malware then conducted software discovery to identify installed applications like kubectl [T1518] and used Set-ADUser to modify user account properties, extracting credentials through reversible encryption [T1556.005]. To evade detection, the actors renamed legitimate utilities, such as masquerading rundll32.exe in a custom directory [T1036.003], and collected data from the local system, including sensitive files [T1005]. Command and control was maintained using one-way communication via PowerShell to download additional payloads [T1102.003], with scheduled transfers pausing C2 communications at specified intervals [T1029]. Network traffic analysis revealed anomalous outbound connections, but these logs are included as noise without technique tagging. The campaign demonstrates a sophisticated blend of persistence and exfiltration tactics, emphasizing the need for robust endpoint monitoring and user awareness training.
