    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the fictional APT group 'Shadow Veil'. Based on simulated incident response data from Acme Global Inc., the campaign began with actors sending spearphishing emails containing malicious Microsoft Office documents to employees in the finance and IT departments. Upon opening the documents, embedded JavaScript executed, downloading a zip file from a compromised website that contained initial access tools. The actors then leveraged stolen credentials from compromised user accounts to authenticate to the victim's Azure tenant, where they used Azure RunCommand to execute administrative commands that deleted log files and obscured forensic evidence while simultaneously establishing persistence by writing a malicious DLL to the Exchange server's transport agent directory to intercept all incoming emails. To maintain stealth, the malware injected into system processes via thread local storage injection to harvest credentials from memory, and the actors employed domain fronting techniques by altering TLS headers to redirect encrypted command-and-control communications through legitimate cloud services, evading network detection. System logs from the Exchange server showed increased CPU usage during off-hours, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured monitoring tools. Acme Global's security team noted unusual Azure activity in the admin portal, including unauthorized role assignments and resource deletions, which were initially attributed to routine maintenance by a third-party contractor. The campaign demonstrates a multi-stage approach combining social engineering, cloud exploitation, and on-premises persistence, with actors likely operating from IP addresses in Eastern Europe, though attribution remains inconclusive in this training scenario.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by the fictional APT group 'Shadow Veil', which targeted a multinational corporation's Azure cloud environment and on-premises Exchange server through spearphishing, credential theft, and stealthy persistence mechanisms. The activity was detected during routine security audits at Acme Global Inc., a manufacturing firm with offices in North America and Europe, where anomalous Azure administrative commands and unusual email traffic patterns were observed. This report is for educational purposes to train blue teams on identifying and mitigating advanced threats in hybrid environments.",
