On June 15, 2024, multiple organizations reported suspicious activity linked to a coordinated cyber campaign. The threat actor, designated as 'ShadowMire', initiated the attack by embedding malicious code in online advertisements to exploit browser vulnerabilities [T1583.008], which prompted users to interact with deceptive prompts, leading to the execution of a malicious payload [T1204]. Once initial access was gained, the adversary leveraged default Administrator accounts [T1078.001] to establish persistence on compromised systems, while simultaneously using PowerShell scripts to enumerate user group affiliations in Azure Active Directory [T1069.003] and discover AWS storage services such as S3 buckets [T1619]. For command and control, the actors abused XMPP's multi-user chat feature to exfiltrate data through encrypted group communications [T1071.005], while malware configured raw socket parameters with setsockopt to intercept trigger packets from the network [T1205.002]. Finally, the campaign employed automated tools to upload collected files to its command-and-control server [T1020]. System logs from affected entities showed routine network traffic spikes unrelated to the incident, and background checks revealed the targeted companies had recently migrated to cloud-based infrastructures without full security audits. No actual data loss was confirmed in this fictional scenario, but the techniques highlight critical vulnerabilities in default configurations and user behavior.
