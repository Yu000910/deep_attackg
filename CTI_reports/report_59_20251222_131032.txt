Background: The fictional target, 'Global Utilities Inc.', is a mid-sized energy provider with operations across North America, utilizing legacy SCADA systems and disconnected networks for safety compliance. On 2023-10-15, anomalous network traffic was detected from a network-attached storage (NAS) device in a remote substation, logging repeated failed authentication attempts to internal servers, which were initially dismissed as glitches. Attack Scenario: Initial Access: The adversary compromised the hardware supply chain by flashing malicious firmware onto a NAS device during manufacturing, creating a hidden backdoor access point [T1195.003]. Execution: Upon deployment at the target site, the NAS device autonomously executed a PowerShell script to gather system information and establish a foothold on connected hosts [T1059.001]. Persistence: To ensure long-term access, the script modified startup items by creating entries in /Library/StartupItems, enabling execution on every system reboot [T1037.005]. Lateral Movement: The actors used removable media, specifically a USB drive labeled 'Maintenance Tools', to drop a malicious executable named 'update.exe', which replicated across air-gapped systems when inserted by unsuspecting technicians [T1091]. Defense Evasion: For stealth, the adversary ran a VirtualBox instance with a Windows 7 virtual machine, configured to map shared network drives, allowing encryption and data theft without direct host interaction [T1564.006]. Command and Control: Communication was obfuscated through dead drop resolvers, leveraging legitimate websites like GitHub and Pastebin to retrieve commands and exfiltrate data [T1102.001]. Additional logs show routine backup failures at 02:00 UTC, unrelated to the attack, and company records indicate a recent software update to version 4.2.1 for the SCADA interface, which had no vulnerabilities exploited in this scenario.
