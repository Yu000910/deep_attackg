PowerGrid Inc., a mid-sized energy provider in the Midwest, reported anomalous network activity on October 15, 2023, including unexpected outbound connections to unknown IP addresses and increased CPU usage on several servers during off-hours. Initial logs showed no signs of intrusion, but further investigation revealed a multi-stage attack. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify targets, though specific details are omitted from this fictional scenario. They then initiated the campaign by sending phishing emails [T1566] disguised as urgent security updates from Microsoft, which included a malicious link that, when clicked, downloaded a custom remote access trojan (RAT) purchased from a dark web marketplace [T1588.001]. This RAT established initial access by exploiting a misconfigured Microsoft Exchange server [T1584.004] to deploy payloads and maintain communication over multiple command-and-control (C2) hosts as fallback channels [T1008]. On Linux systems, the adversary edited /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root [T1053.003] to schedule a cryptocurrency miner to run daily at midnight, while on Windows systems, they modified the Office registry key [T1137.002] to load a malicious add-in at startup and deployed a malicious service file via systemd timers [T1053.006] to execute a keylogger on system boot, simultaneously using svchost.exe to run a malicious DLL [T1569] for bypassing application whitelisting. PowerGrid's security team noted increased network latency and unusual process names like 'svchost_helper.exe', but no data exfiltration was confirmed in this training scenario. Regular system audits and employee training are recommended to mitigate such threats.
