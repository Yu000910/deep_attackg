ShadowHawk actors conducted reconnaissance to identify target domains and infrastructure, leveraging dynamic DNS providers to establish command and control (C2) infrastructure with legitimate-looking subdomains [T1583.001] while simultaneously acquiring code signing certificates through fake business identities to sign malicious software [T1588.003]. Initial access was achieved via hardware additions, where a USB Rubber Ducky disguised as a standard flash drive was planted in a corporate breakroom, exploiting human curiosity to execute payloads [T1200]. Upon execution, the malware employed Component Object Model (COM) techniques, using Microsoft.Office.Interop objects to insert malicious macros into documents [T1559.001] and deployed PowerShell scripts to create Azure virtual machines in unused or unsupported cloud regions with security logging disabled [T1535]. Persistence and lateral movement involved credential access through Kerberoasting, utilizing tools like Rubeus and Invoke-Kerberoast to steal AES hashes from service accounts [T1558.003], while exfiltration and C2 communications were concealed by encoding network traffic with non-standard Base64 encoding, removing padding characters to evade detection [T1132.002]. System logs from affected endpoints showed unusual PowerShell activity at 14:30 UTC, and background checks revealed the targeted company, 'EnergyGrid Inc.', had recently expanded its cloud footprint without updating security policies. No actual data breaches occurred in this training scenario.
