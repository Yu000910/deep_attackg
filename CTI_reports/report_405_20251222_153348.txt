The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to alert organizations about a fictional threat actor, 'ShadowGrip', conducting a targeted campaign against cloud service providers and virtualized environments. This report is based on simulated incidents for training purposes and includes realistic but fabricated details to enhance blue team readiness.

Background: The targeted organization, a mid-sized technology firm 'TechNova Inc.', operates a hybrid infrastructure with Microsoft Azure for cloud services and VMware for on-premises virtualization. Initial logs from Azure Active Directory showed unusual administrative activity from a delegated administrator account, which was later traced to a compromised partner entity.

Attack Narrative:
- **Initial Access and Privilege Escalation**: The actors exploited a trusted relationship with a third-party vendor [T1199], leveraging delegated administrator permissions to gain administrative access to TechNova's Azure tenant. This allowed them to bypass multi-factor authentication and access sensitive resources.
- **Execution and Persistence**: Using physical access to an on-premises server room, the adversary inserted a rogue USB device that simulated keyboard inputs [T1674] to execute malicious commands, establishing persistence via scheduled tasks and modifying system configurations.
- **Discovery and Reconnaissance**: After gaining access, the actors conducted reconnaissance on the virtualization environment by running commands like 'esxcli software vib list' [T1673] to identify virtual machines (VMs) and assess potential targets for further exploitation.
- **Command and Control (C2)**: The malware employed file transfer protocols such as FTP [T1071.002] to communicate with actor-controlled C2 servers, downloading additional payloads and exfiltration tools while evading network detection.
- **Exfiltration**: Corporate intellectual property, including source code and design documents, was automatically exfiltrated using scripts that saved data to text storage sites like pastebin.com [T1567.003]. Additionally, the actors used automated copy functions [T1020] to transfer sensitive files from air-gapped systems via USB storage devices, blending physical and digital theft methods.

Mitigation Recommendations: Organizations should review delegated administrator permissions, enforce strict physical security controls, monitor for unusual virtualization commands, and implement data loss prevention solutions. This advisory serves as a training exercise to highlight complex attack chains involving both cloud and on-premises assets.
