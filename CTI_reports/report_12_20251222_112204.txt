The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on the fictional APT group 'SilentTemp', active since early 2024, targeting organizations in the technology and finance sectors. Initial reconnaissance involved monitoring social media platforms for employee information, though no specific techniques were tagged here. The actors first conducted phishing campaigns [T1586.001] by sending deceptive Microsoft Teams notifications to compromise corporate credentials, which they then leveraged to gain unauthorized access via VPN services [T1133] while using modified versions of publicly-available tools like Empire and PsExec [T1588.002] to establish initial footholds. Upon entry, they executed commands through the kubelet API [T1609] to manipulate running containers and created scheduled tasks [T1053.005] for persistence, simultaneously injecting malicious DLLs into svchost.exe [T1014] to deploy rootkits that maintained stealth. For discovery, they enumerated running services [T1007] to identify critical systems and exploited harvested OAuth tokens [T1550.001] to access email accounts, facilitating lateral movement. Data exfiltration was conducted by leveraging web services like iplogger.org [T1102] to send collected information back to command-and-control servers, while compressing and storing data incrementally at controlled endpoints [T1030] to evade network traffic alerts and configuring scripts to backup stolen data to external storage media [T1052]. Logs from affected systems showed unusual network traffic spikes, but these were not tagged as they represent normal noise. The campaign highlights the need for enhanced monitoring of cloud and container environments.
