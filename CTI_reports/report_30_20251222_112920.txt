The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign designated 'SilentPhish'. This campaign targets retail organizations, focusing on e-commerce platforms and customer databases. Actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify high-value employees, such as IT administrators and marketing personnel. Background: The targeted organization, 'RetailCorp', operates multiple online stores with a customer base of over 2 million users. System logs from the incident show anomalous DNS queries beginning on 2023-10-15, but initial access occurred earlier. The actors initiated the attack by sending spearphishing emails [T1566] disguised as Pinterest notifications, which included malicious .scr files attached, and simultaneously created fake Pinterest boards [T1566.003] with links to compromised e-commerce websites to lure victims. Upon execution, the malware employed PowerShell [T1059.001] with the command 'powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File malicious.ps1' to bypass security restrictions [T1564.011] and actively download additional payloads [T1105] while modifying registry keys [T1112] for persistence. During runtime, the attacker used dlopen to load a shared object [T1129] containing keylogging functionality, which was stored in a hidden directory. To facilitate lateral movement, the threat actor modified the firewall configuration [T1599] to create exceptions for their malicious traffic between network segments, allowing data exfiltration via DNS queries [T1071.004]. In credential access phases, the actor impersonated legitimate IT personnel [T1656] in phone calls and text messages to direct victims to a credential harvesting site, and ran 'net user' commands [T1110] to enumerate local user accounts on the target Windows machine. Additional noise: Network monitoring detected increased traffic to pinterest.com domains, but this was unrelated to the attack. The campaign's command and control infrastructure utilized DNS [T1071.004] for communication, as observed with Cobian RAT-like behavior. Remediation steps include reviewing firewall rules and implementing multi-factor authentication.
