Crimson Shadow actors initiated their campaign by establishing a shared Dropbox folder accessible only through burner accounts for data exfiltration [T1585.003], while simultaneously deploying a malicious JavaScript file that executed a PowerShell script to download additional payloads [T1608.004] via drive-by compromise methods. Upon gaining access, the malware abused system-assigned managed identities to maintain persistent access to Azure Key Vault resources [T1078.004] and employed the Windows Script Host COM interface to execute malicious scripts locally [T1559.001]. The attackers then modified New-GPOImmediateTask.ps1 to embed commands that disable security controls across the domain [T1484.001] and wrote a PowerShell script location to the HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript registry value for persistence through logon scripts [T1037.001]. During lateral movement, the actors used net user /domain to enumerate domain accounts [T1087.002] and implemented a passive listener capable of identifying a specific magic value before executing tasking as a secondary command and control mechanism [T1205]. To disrupt operations, they used 'sc stop Spooler' to halt the print spooler service [T1489] and attempted to reboot machines by terminating specific processes [T1529]. System logs from the affected environment showed routine authentication events from user 'jsmith' at 10:15 AM on 2023-10-05, unrelated to the attack, and the company's background includes a recent merger with a tech startup, which expanded its cloud footprint but introduced integration challenges. Network traffic analysis revealed encrypted connections to IP 192.168.1.100 on port 443, consistent with normal business operations, and no anomalies were detected in the firewall rules updated last month.
