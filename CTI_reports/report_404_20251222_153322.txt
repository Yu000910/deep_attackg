APT-99 likely conducted reconnaissance by querying DNS servers to gather victim network information [T1590] and identify mail exchange (MX) records using passive DNS techniques [T1596.001], while also scanning databases like Censys for SSH servers with weak encryption algorithms [T1596.005]. The actors compromised the supply chain by modifying a continuous integration server to inject credential-stealing malware into production builds [T1195]. Upon execution, they used the Lua interpreter [T1059.011] to run system commands for further reconnaissance and leveraged SSH [T1021.004] to gain remote control of a compromised Linux server. For persistence, the malware employed launchctl [T1569.001] to activate a malicious service and created a systemd timer [T1053.006] to execute data exfiltration scripts every six hours, while also modifying TCC.db [T1548.006] to grant camera access permissions and using dynamic linker hijacking [T1574.006] by altering LD_PRELOAD to load a malicious shared object. The spyware implemented mutual exclusion [T1480.002] by querying 'malware.exe' to avoid conflicts with other processes. For command and control, the attacker abused POP3S [T1071.003] to retrieve instructions from a compromised email account, and for exfiltration, they used OpenSSL to encrypt financial data over asymmetric encrypted non-C2 protocols [T1048.002]. System logs from the affected server show routine cron jobs and network traffic spikes unrelated to the attack, with the company's background involving standard financial software updates and employee training sessions on phishing awareness.
