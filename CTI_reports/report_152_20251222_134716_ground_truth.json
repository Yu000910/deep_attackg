    "clean_text": "On October 15, 2023, a fictional organization, TechGlobal Inc., reported anomalous network activity leading to the discovery of a sophisticated intrusion. TechGlobal Inc., a mid-sized software development company with offices in New York and London, experienced unusual spikes in network traffic during off-peak hours, as logged in their SIEM system (Event ID 4688). Initial investigation revealed that an adversary, likely APT-99, conducted reconnaissance by passively monitoring network communications using a hardware network tap inserted into an unsecured server room. This allowed the actors to capture unencrypted credentials from LDAP authentication packets. Subsequently, the actors abused schtasks.exe to schedule execution of a malicious payload, spyware.exe, during off-peak business hours, while simultaneously modifying the ~/.bash_profile on Linux servers to establish persistence by running a backdoor on shell startup. The malware then collected sensitive information from Microsoft SharePoint services, including project documents and user permissions, and accessed team collaboration notes and meeting minutes from the Confluence repository. Additionally, the Trojan.Karagany variant was deployed to capture keystrokes on compromised hosts, and the actors used web services such as Paste.ee to host and distribute payloads for command and control. Logs from the firewall (Cisco ASA) showed multiple outbound connections to suspicious IP addresses, but no further lateral movement was detected at this stage.",
