The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional threat actor, APT 'ShadowMint,' active in targeting financial organizations. This report is based on a simulated scenario for educational purposes, designed to enhance defensive capabilities against advanced persistent threats.

Background: The victim organization, 'GlobalTrust Bank,' is a mid-sized financial institution with operations across North America. Initial alerts were triggered by unusual network traffic patterns from branch office routers, followed by anomalous login attempts to internal banking systems. System logs from the past week show increased failed authentication events on employee workstations, but these were initially dismissed as user error.

Attack Narrative:
1. Initial Access: The actors conducted spear-phishing campaigns [T1566] targeting bank employees with tailored emails containing malicious links, which led to credential harvesting pages. Concurrently, they exploited a known vulnerability in SOHO routers at branch offices to gain administrative access [T1584.008], allowing them to intercept and modify network traffic.
2. Execution and Persistence: Using stolen credentials from the phishing campaign, the adversaries authenticated as valid users [T1078] to access internal systems, where they deployed malware via PowerShell scripts. They then leveraged the bank's endpoint management platform, Altiris, for lateral movement [T1072] across the network, installing backdoors on critical servers.
3. Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion: On compromised systems, the actors executed Mimikatz to extract NTLM hashes from local accounts [T1078.003], enabling privilege escalation to domain administrator levels. To evade detection, they used steganography tools [T1001.002] to embed command and control data within benign image files uploaded to cloud storage, blending malicious traffic with normal web activity.
4. Impact and Exfiltration: The actors accessed the bank's identity management console to manipulate device registrations [T1098.005], excluding specific administrative users from multi-factor authentication enforcement, which facilitated unauthorized access to transaction systems. They then exfiltrated financial data through encrypted channels, using the compromised routers as proxies to obscure their origin.

Irrelevant Information: GlobalTrust Bank's IT team reported minor performance issues in their email servers during this period, unrelated to the attack. Additionally, routine maintenance logs show scheduled updates to firewall rules that coincided with the incident timeline, but these were pre-planned and not malicious. The bank's CEO issued a statement emphasizing customer data security, though no real breach occurred in this fictional scenario.

Mitigation Recommendations: Blue teams should implement network segmentation, monitor for unusual router configurations, enforce strong multi-factor authentication, and conduct regular phishing awareness training. Reviewing logs from software deployment tools for unauthorized activities is also advised.
