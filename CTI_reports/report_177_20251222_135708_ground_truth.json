    "clean_text": "COATHANGER, a sophisticated threat actor, initiated this campaign by compromising a widely used development build tool, injecting a hidden cryptocurrency miner into software builds distributed to multiple organizations. To facilitate credential theft, the actors established a serverless redirect service using AWS Lambda, which captured and forwarded stolen credentials to external servers. Upon initial access, the malware exploited an unquoted path vulnerability by placing a malicious executable at C:\\program.exe, allowing it to hijack legitimate program execution paths on Windows systems. For persistence and reconnaissance, the actors modified the PowerShell profile (profile.ps1) to automatically run commands that gathered system information and network data each time PowerShell was launched, while also querying SharePoint repositories to harvest organizational charts and reporting structures for targeting purposes. In virtualized environments, COATHANGER utilized the vSphere Web Services SDK to execute arbitrary commands on compromised guest virtual machines and deployed a compromised vSphere Installation Bundle (VIB) to the hypervisor, ensuring persistent command and control connectivity. For communication, the backdoor employed ICMP to transmit configuration data to and from its command and control servers and encrypted collected system information using RC4, exfiltrating it over symmetric encrypted non-C2 protocols to avoid detection. Throughout the campaign, the trojan secretly installed mining software that hijacked system resources to generate cryptocurrency revenue, impacting performance and operational efficiency. During the investigation, analysts observed routine system logs showing normal user activity, such as scheduled backups and software updates, which were unrelated to the malicious activities. The targeted organization, a mid-sized fintech company with operations in North America and Europe, reported no prior significant security incidents, but this campaign highlighted vulnerabilities in their supply chain and virtualization management.",
