The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign. This scenario is based on simulated activities attributed to the group Cinnamon Tempest, which has historically targeted financial and critical infrastructure sectors. In this campaign, the actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify high-value targets, though no specific indicators have been confirmed in this simulation.

Initial access was achieved through the compromise of domain administrator accounts [T1078.002], allowing the adversary to deploy malware across the network. System logs from the affected environment show unusual login attempts from external IP addresses, but these were not flagged due to misconfigured alerting rules. Once inside, the actors employed PowerShell [T1059.001] to actively download malicious payloads [T1105] from command and control (C2) servers while simultaneously modifying registry keys [T1112] to establish persistence. For example, a PowerShell script scheduled a malicious timer task called 'WindowsDefenderScan' to run daily [T1053.006], and ransomware abused Win32_ScheduledJob to schedule encryption routines during low-activity periods [T1053.002].

Persistence mechanisms included the use of image file execution options injection [T1546.012] when admin privileges were detected on Windows systems newer than Windows 7, and the threat actor allocated malicious.dll in a remote process to conceal its execution through reflective code loading [T1620]. Additionally, the actors exploited path interception opportunities in the PATH environment variable [T1574.007] to escalate privileges, as observed in tools like PowerSploit. For command and control, APT12's RIPTIDE RAT was simulated, which communicates over HTTP with payloads encrypted using symmetric cryptography [T1573.001] such as RC4. Network traffic analysis revealed encrypted packets, but decryption keys were not recovered in this training exercise. The campaign's objectives included data exfiltration and ransomware deployment, with no real-world impact reported.
