The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional APT campaign. Attackers likely exploited default credentials on a SOHO router [T1584.008] to install a persistent backdoor, while simultaneously abusing Twitter's direct messaging feature [T1583.006] to send targeted victims links to credential harvesting sites. The actors then employed a customized PlugX variant [T1091] to replicate through USB connections and spread across the network. For execution, they used JavaScript [T1059.007] to facilitate drive-by downloads and establish command and control communications, and abused the network device CLI [T1059.008] with commands like 'no cdp run' to disable Cisco Discovery Protocol and evade detection. During discovery, the malware executed 'netsh wlan show profile key=clear' [T1016.002] to gather Wi-Fi credentials and accessed the instance metadata service endpoint [T1614] to determine the cloud instance's geographic placement. For command and control, the attacker utilized POP3S [T1071.003] to retrieve instructions from a compromised email account. Logs from the affected router showed unusual outbound traffic to IP addresses in Eastern Europe, but no anomalies were detected in the company's primary firewall, which had been recently updated. The targeted organization, a mid-sized manufacturing firm, reported no financial losses, but the incident highlighted gaps in their network segmentation policies.
