The actors initiated reconnaissance by using an automated script to query SecureBank's corporate website, extracting employee directory information to identify key roles such as IT administrators and financial officers [T1591.004], while simultaneously querying public DNS records to map subdomains and understand network trust dependencies, revealing segmentation between internal and external zones [T1590.003]. They then leveraged a paid threat intelligence feed to gather intelligence on the target's email infrastructure, identifying vulnerabilities in mail server configurations [T1597.001]. Following this, the adversary compromised the software supply chain by replacing a legitimate compiled binary on SecureBank's software distribution server with a trojanized version, which was subsequently deployed to endpoints during routine updates [T1195.002]. Upon execution, the malware established persistence by creating a scheduled task in Windows Task Scheduler to run malicious.exe daily at 3 AM [T1053] and employed path interception by writing a malicious version of 'crypt32.dll' into a directory with higher search precedence, hijacking the search order to load the malicious DLL [T1574.008]. The malware then modified the authentication process by intercepting private keys through a trojanized ssh-add function, allowing unauthorized access to encrypted communications [T1556], and evaded detection by modifying Group Policy Objects to disable security logging and alter firewall rules [T1484.001]. For command and control, the actors used removable media, writing encrypted commands to a USB flash drive to bypass network segmentation and exfiltrate data from air-gapped systems [T1092]. Finally, the malware encrypted targeted files for impact using a combination of RSA and AES-CBC algorithms on a predefined list of file extensions, rendering critical financial data inaccessible [T1486]. System logs from SecureBank's SIEM showed increased CPU usage on affected servers during the encryption phase, but this noise did not correlate with the attack techniques.
