During the simulated incident C0027, the fictional threat actor 'Silent Echo' impersonated legitimate IT support personnel in phone calls to direct victims to download a remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool, facilitating initial access [T1566.004]. Concurrently, the adversary deployed rogue USB devices emulating keyboards to simulate keystrokes that opened command prompts and executed malicious scripts [T1674]. Once established, the actors scheduled a malicious container deployment using CronJob to run during system maintenance windows, leveraging container orchestration for execution [T1053.007]. To maintain persistence, they installed a service mimicking RawPOS, ensuring continued access after reboots [T1543.003]. For evasion, the attackers dropped msxsl.exe to the temp directory to process XSL scripts and bypass application whitelisting [T1220]. They then executed Mimikatz.exe to extract Kerberos tickets from memory, enabling pass-the-hash attacks for lateral movement [T1550.002]. Using an RPC server similar to Stuxnet, they transferred tools peer-to-peer within the network, facilitating lateral movement [T1570]. The actors collected sensitive configuration files from an Amazon S3 bucket, stealing data from cloud storage [T1530]. To obfuscate command and control, they employed domain fronting to mask hard-coded C2 server domains [T1090.004]. Finally, the malware used openssl to encrypt stolen files and uploaded them to a trusted web service for exfiltration [T1567]. System logs from the affected environment show routine maintenance activities at 02:00 UTC, with no immediate alerts triggered. The company, a mid-sized financial services firm, reported unusual network spikes during off-hours, but initial investigations attributed this to backup processes. Further analysis revealed unauthorized access to cloud storage buckets, though no data loss was confirmed in this training scenario.
