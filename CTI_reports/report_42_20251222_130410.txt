Storm-1811, a fictional advanced persistent threat group, has been observed conducting a simulated cyber campaign against corporate networks. The actors initiated reconnaissance by scanning client device configurations across the corporate environment using network mapping tools like nmap [T1592.004]. Concurrently, they developed a custom credential harvesting module disguised as a legitimate system utility to enhance their attack capabilities [T1587]. For initial access, Storm-1811 employed spearphishing voice calls, posing as IT support to prompt users into downloading and executing malicious scripts [T1566.004]. Upon execution, the attack script malicious.ps1 automatically established persistence and maintained access to the victim's system [T1588.007]. The adversary then used the Windows Command Shell (cmd.exe) to execute commands for further exploitation [T1059.003] while abusing pubprn.vbs with a remote UNC path to deploy ransomware on the target system [T1216.001]. In a credential theft phase, the malware invoked Set-ADUser to alter user object settings, facilitating plaintext password recovery from the domain controller through reversible encryption [T1556.005]. Throughout the campaign, Gold Dragon, a component of the malware, checked running processes on the victim's machine for reconnaissance and evasion [T1057]. Additionally, the spyware implemented RSA encryption for secure command and control (C2) message transmission, ensuring covert communication [T1573]. Logs from the victim's firewall showed increased outbound traffic to suspicious IP addresses, though no actual data exfiltration occurred in this training scenario. The company, a mid-sized financial services firm, reported no operational impact, as this was part of a controlled exercise.
