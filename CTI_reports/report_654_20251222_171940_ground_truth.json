    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide information on a fictional threat actor, 'Crimson Lotus', based on simulated activities for training purposes. This report outlines a campaign dubbed 'Operation Silent Harvest', which leverages a combination of social engineering and technical exploits to compromise cloud environments and user systems. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance by establishing email accounts to register domains and obtaining SSL certificates for their command and control (C2) domains, mimicking legitimate infrastructure. Initial access was achieved through a phishing campaign where users received emails with a spoofed 'Microsoft Office Activation Wizard' attachment; when users clicked 'Activate Now', the adversary executed a malicious script via copy and paste actions that injected payloads into system memory. Execution involved the script modifying the boot configuration to load an unauthorized network operating system through the TFTP protocol, enabling persistent access. The actors then abused system-assigned managed identities to maintain long-term access to cloud compute resources, allowing them to exfiltrate data and deploy additional tools. In a parallel effort, the adversary exploited a vulnerable ISP infrastructure to inject malicious advertisements into web traffic, redirecting users to compromised sites for further exploitation. System logs from affected organizations show increased network traffic to unknown domains, but these were initially dismissed as false positives. The company background includes a mid-sized financial services firm with hybrid cloud deployments, where the attack was detected during routine security audits. Remediation involved revoking compromised certificates, resetting cloud identities, and patching vulnerable systems.",
