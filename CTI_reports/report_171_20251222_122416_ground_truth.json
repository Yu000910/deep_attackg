    "clean_text": "TechGlobal Inc., a company with operations in North America and Europe, reported unusual network traffic from its Azure environment, initially detected by a spike in outbound connections on port 443. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by using compromised employee credentials to access the Azure portal and execute Azure Resource Manager API calls, listing all virtual machines across multiple subscriptions to map the cloud infrastructure. Following this, they employed stolen SSH public keys to authenticate to internal Linux servers, hijacking SSH sessions for lateral movement while simultaneously using pass the hash techniques to move across Windows domains. System logs from server 'svr-az-001' show failed login attempts from IP 192.168.1.100, though these were unrelated and not tagged. To obscure malicious activity, the adversary deployed a Docker container using 'docker create' commands, masking network traffic as normal container communications and altering TLS compression method headers to redirect encrypted communications through domain fronting. Additionally, they executed a reconnaissance script that utilized the Azure Blob Storage List Blobs operation with prefix filtering to discover specific file types like .pdf and .docx across storage accounts and queried Microsoft Teams via API to collect user credentials shared in private channels. In a parallel effort, they set up a fake login portal to capture credentials as users attempted to change passwords, redirecting text-based codes to controlled websites. Network monitoring indicated increased traffic to external IP 10.0.0.5, but this was later attributed to a misconfigured firewall rule and is not tagged. The campaign demonstrates a multi-faceted approach to cloud exploitation and credential theft.",

The campaign leverages compromised credentials, container deployment for obfuscation, and cloud service discovery techniques, as observed in a fictional incident at a multinational technology firm, 'TechGlobal Inc.', between January and March 2024. Blue teams are advised to review logs for anomalous SSH activity, Azure API calls, and container deployments.",
