The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign dubbed 'Operation Dream Job'. Actors likely conduct reconnaissance by gathering corporate email addresses through Autodiscover API requests [T1589.002] and analyzing historical DNS query logs from public sources to map victim network infrastructure [T1590.002], while simultaneously collecting victim organization information such as employee roles and network details to identify high-value targets [T1591]. In the initial access phase, the adversary utilized malvertising by purchasing ad inventory on a popular gaming platform to distribute trojanized software [T1583.008] and hosted malicious scripts on Google Firebase to evade detection [T1583.006], then delivered spearphishing emails with malicious attachments designed to appear as job offers [T1566.001] that, when opened, executed malicious files to gain initial foothold [T1204.002]. Upon execution, the malware saved a remote access tool from https://c2.com/tools to the victim's temp directory [T1608.002] and added a .desktop configuration file to the user's ~/.config/autostart directory for persistence without root privileges [T1547.013], while dropping a malicious DLL into the System32 directory to intercept authentication credentials via network provider hooks [T1556.008]. For discovery and lateral movement, the actors collected the domain name of compromised networks [T1016] and employed adversary-in-the-middle techniques using ARP spoofing to intercept credentials transmitted over the network [T1557], while abusing DHCP INFORM messages to gather network configuration details from clients [T1557.003]. In the collection phase, the attacker used AppleScript to generate a fake system update dialog requesting admin passwords [T1056.002]. For command and control, Remexi malware communicated with the C2 server over HTTP using BITSAdmin [T1071.001]. Finally, exfiltration was achieved via USB Rubber Ducky scripts designed to collect system configuration files from compromised workstations [T1052.001]. System logs from affected endpoints showed increased network traffic to unknown IPs, but no actual data loss occurred in this training scenario. The fictional company 'GameTech Inc.' reported anomalous activity during routine monitoring, highlighting the need for enhanced email filtering and network segmentation.
