The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform defenders about a simulated APT campaign observed in a training environment targeting financial institutions. The campaign begins with the adversary conducting reconnaissance [T1589] to identify key personnel and vendor relationships. In the Initial Access phase, the actor initiated a spearphishing voice call [T1566.004] posing as IT support, tricking an employee into revealing their system credentials, which were then used to gain initial foothold. Leveraging a trusted relationship [T1199], the malicious actor exploited delegated administrative privileges from a third-party vendor to create new administrative accounts within the target organization's Active Directory, logging these actions in system logs that showed unusual account creation events at 14:30 UTC on 2023-10-05. During Execution, the adversary employed PowerShell [T1059.001] to download the IcedID malware from a GitHub repository [T1102], which then used native APIs [T1106] such as ZwWriteVirtualMemory and NtResumeThread to inject itself into a remote svchost.exe process while simultaneously querying the registry [T1012] to enumerate keys and values for persistence configuration. In the Discovery phase, the actor conducted system network configuration discovery [T1016] by running ipconfig/all and sending web beacons via email to gather details on network topology, and performed local email collection [T1114.001] using PowerShell commands to locate and copy PST files from user profile directories, with logs indicating file access anomalies in the C:\Users\ directory. The campaign concluded with data exfiltration over web services [T1102], where collected data was uploaded to a controlled GitHub account, as noted in firewall logs showing outbound connections to github.com at 16:45 UTC. This scenario is purely educational and does not reflect real-world incidents.
