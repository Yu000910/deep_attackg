On October 26, 2023, PowerGrid Dynamics, a fictional energy provider based in Chicago with 500 employees, reported anomalous network activity. Initial investigation revealed that CrimsonWave actors likely conducted reconnaissance through open-source intelligence, though no specific techniques were tagged here. The attack began with a phishing email [T1566] masquerading as a software update from a trusted vendor, which contained a malicious executable attachment. Upon execution, the malware exploited the Internet Explorer COM object [T1559.001] to run arbitrary commands, including downloading additional payloads and modifying system processes. The actors then used compromised credentials to access the network via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) [T1133], establishing initial foothold. System logs from server 'SRV-APP-01' showed unusual svchost.exe modifications at 14:30 UTC, where the malicious DLL was executed to create a new Windows service [T1543.003] for persistence, while simultaneously altering Docker container runtime options [T1543.005] to disable security features and maintain elevated privileges. During lateral movement, the actors employed VNC [T1021.005] to access other systems and used net user commands [T1087.001] to enumerate local accounts, as observed in event logs on workstation 'WS-ENG-05'. For data collection, the malware executed Outlook.exe to harvest email messages from local PST files [T1114], and exfiltrated this data through HTTP GET requests containing base64-encoded files [T1048.003], while obfuscating C2 traffic as normal traffic to sites like GitHub [T1102.002] for bidirectional communication. Finally, the actors injected a PowerShell script to render fake update notifications that covered active application windows [T1491], causing defacement and disrupting operations. PowerGrid Dynamics' firewall logs indicated increased outbound traffic to unknown IPs, but this was not tagged as a specific technique. The company's incident response team contained the attack within 48 hours, but data loss was estimated at 2 TB.
