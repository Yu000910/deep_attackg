Crimson Lotus likely conducts initial reconnaissance by manipulating search engine results through SEO poisoning [T1608.006], targeting employees of financial firms with high-traffic keywords embedded in hidden div elements on compromised websites. The actors then deliver malicious Word attachments via spearphishing emails [T1566.001], which, when opened, execute JavaScript [T1059.007] to download and run PowerShell scripts that modify the PowerShell profile [T1546.013] to establish a reverse shell upon startup. After gaining initial access, the adversary uses pass the hash techniques [T1550.002] with tools like Invoke-SMBExec for lateral movement within the network, while simultaneously deploying custom video capture malware [T1125] to monitor victim environments. For command and control, Crimson Lotus leverages remote access tools [T1219] such as ConnectWise Control to deploy additional payloads, and exfiltrates data by encrypting credentials with RC4 [T1048.001] over HTTP POST requests before uploading stolen files to cloud storage services like Google Drive [T1567.002]. Additionally, the actors implement bandwidth hijacking [T1496.002] through proxyware to redirect all outbound traffic through compromised residential proxies, obscuring their exfiltration activities. System logs from a simulated victim, 'Global Finance Corp.', show anomalous PowerShell executions and network traffic spikes, though these are part of the training scenario and not indicative of real compromise. The company's background includes operations in multiple countries, with no actual security breaches reported.
