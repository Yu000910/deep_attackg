    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional APT campaign for training purposes. SHADOW SERPENT actors likely conducted reconnaissance by collecting organizational intelligence from a paid dark web monitoring service. Initial access was achieved through a compromised hardware supply chain, where the attacker programmed a Teensy device to automatically run PowerShell scripts for lateral movement. Upon execution, the adversary employed Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) field codes in a crafted document to run system commands on the target machine while simultaneously using klist.exe to identify cached TGT tickets for potential extraction. System logs from the victim environment show routine backups at 02:00 UTC, but no anomalies were flagged during this phase. For persistence and discovery, the actors utilized Pacu to enumerate IAM users, roles, and groups in cloud accounts, and data staging involved using 'bash -c 'find /home -name *.pdf > /tmp/staged_files.txt'' to collect PDF documents into a staging file with RawPOS placing captured data in a temporary file under a directory named 'memdump'. The company, a mid-sized energy provider, reported normal network traffic patterns, though internal audits noted minor configuration drifts. Command and control was established using DNS for communications over non-standard ports, with WellMail observed using TCP port 25 without SMTP to leverage an open port for secure command and control. Finally, exfiltration occurred over existing command and control channels, as Leviathan exfiltrated collected data during simulated intrusions. Network monitoring tools detected unusual DNS queries but were initially dismissed as false positives.",

The campaign involves sophisticated techniques including dark web reconnaissance, hardware supply chain compromise, and multi-stage exploitation for data exfiltration. Blue teams are advised to review logs and implement mitigations as outlined.",
