    "clean_text": "Crimson Serpent likely conducted reconnaissance by searching the victim organization's careers page to determine physical office addresses in multiple cities, which informed subsequent physical intrusion attempts. The actors initiated the attack by sending spearphishing emails containing malicious links that, when clicked, redirected victims through EvilProxy to intercept authentication tokens during login processes. Concurrently, the threat actor planted a USB Rubber Ducky disguised as a standard flash drive in a corporate breakroom to facilitate hardware-based initial access. Once inside the network, the adversary employed service execution techniques, using Winexe to install and run a malicious service on remote systems before uninstalling it to evade detection, while on macOS environments, they used 'launchctl submit' to submit jobs as system services for persistent execution. For persistence, the attacker modified the com.apple.loginwindow.plist file to execute malicious code during user logins and in containerized environments, altered ClusterRoleBinding.yaml files to assign cluster-admin privileges to compromised service accounts. The actors then escalated privileges by running PowerShell scripts to enumerate local administrator groups and used pth.exe to authenticate to file servers with stolen administrator hashes in a pass-the-hash attack. To maintain stealth, the malware was configured to write encrypted commands to USB drives for physical data transfer, and the adversary utilized wevtutil.exe to query application logs for sensitive information. Additionally, in cloud infrastructure, tools like Pacu were employed to generate SSH and API keys for AWS, adding unauthorized cloud credentials. System logs from the victim's SIEM showed routine network traffic spikes, but these were unrelated to the malicious activity. The organization, a mid-sized bank with branches in three states, reported no prior incidents of this scale, though internal audits had flagged minor policy violations in the past quarter.",
