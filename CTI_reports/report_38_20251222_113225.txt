On October 15, 2023, a financial organization, 'SecureBank Inc.', reported suspicious activity following a phishing campaign. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by abusing weak DMARC policies to send spoofed emails [T1672] that appeared to originate from the HR department, tricking employees into clicking malicious links. Upon initial access, the adversary employed PowerShell to download a payload from a dead drop resolver [T1102.001] while simultaneously querying the registry to identify installed software [T1012] and listing running processes [T1057] to assess the environment. For persistence, they modified registry run keys [T1547.001] to execute a script at startup and used local accounts [T1078.003] to spawn services [T1569] that loaded malicious DLLs via svchost.exe. To escalate privileges, a compromised service impersonated a SYSTEM-level token [T1134.003] and dumped Kerberos tickets [T1550.003] for lateral movement. The actors then exploited stolen access keys to discover cloud infrastructure [T1580] by executing ListBuckets commands, mapping storage assets. During the final stage, they stopped critical services [T1489], such as MS SQL, to release file locks before encrypting data. System logs from SecureBank showed normal network traffic spikes at 2:00 AM, unrelated to the attack, and background checks revealed the company had recently migrated to hybrid cloud environments, though this did not directly facilitate the intrusion.
