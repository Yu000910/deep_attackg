Crimson Shadow actors initiated reconnaissance by searching domain analysis websites to gather information on the victim's web infrastructure [T1596.003] and querying DNS AXFR to discover all registered hosts and services in the zone [T1590.002], while malware scraped the victim organization's 'Contact Us' page for physical addresses [T1591.001]. The malware then exploited a compromised ISP channel to redirect user traffic through a malicious proxy [T1659], and social engineering reconnaissance searched LinkedIn.com for employees who recently joined the company [T1656]. In the execution phase, the attacker used docker exec -it container_name /bin/bash to interactively control a container [T1609] and executed malicious.dylib by exploiting a vulnerable application's library search path [T1574.004]. For persistence, the threat actor wrote a registry entry at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\CustomProvider to execute their payload [T1547.003] and exploited ptrace system calls to attach to a running process and execute malicious code [T1055.014]. Malicious code was written into a file named 'malicious.php' that was disguised as a routine system update script [T1036.008]. In discovery, Epic collected the user name from the victim’s machine [T1033], Torisma used WTSEnumerateSessionsW to monitor remote desktop connections [T1049], and Volt Typhoon employed Ping to check network connectivity [T1016.001]. During lateral movement, APT29 used RDP sessions from public-facing systems to internal servers [T1021.001], with SideTwist primarily using port 443 for C2 but able to use port 80 as a fallback [T1008]. For impact, malware used 'Set-LocalUser -Name 'ServiceAccount' -Password (ConvertTo-SecureString 'WeakPass123' -AsPlainText -Force)' to set a weak password on a service account [T1531]. System logs from the victim's network showed routine HTTP requests to benign domains like update.example.com, and the organization, a fictional energy provider 'GridPower Inc.', had recently migrated to cloud-based services, with no evidence of data exfiltration in this scenario.
