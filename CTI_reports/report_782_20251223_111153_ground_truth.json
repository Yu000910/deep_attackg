    "clean_text": "On 2023-10-15, a fictional financial institution, 'SecureBank Corp.', reported anomalous network activity leading to a data breach. Initial investigation revealed that the threat actor, 'ShadowHook', likely conducted reconnaissance through open-source intelligence (OSINT) to identify key employees, though no specific technique tags are assigned to this phase as it falls outside the provided scenario. The attack commenced when the adversary sent spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to targeted employees, exploiting human vulnerabilities to gain initial access. Upon execution, the malware, dubbed 'Flagpro', was activated and used Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to gather system information and spawn processes for code injection, while simultaneously discovering the system owner or user to tailor further actions. To establish persistence, the malware replaced the legitimate termsrv.dll with a backdoored version, ensuring continued access even after reboots. For command and control (C2), the actors employed fast flux DNS to mask their C2 channels behind rotating IP addresses and utilized domain fronting by manipulating HTTP Host Headers to evade network-based detection. Additionally, they tainted shared content by copying rogue software to a team collaboration folder disguised as a legitimate document, spreading the infection laterally within the network. To facilitate malware distribution, the attacker uploaded the malicious payload to a private GitHub repository for later retrieval and altered the Apache httpd.conf file to install a compromised SSL certificate, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept sensitive data. During the encryption phase, the malware automatically terminated processes that could interfere with file extraction or encryption operations, ensuring successful data exfiltration. Logs from SecureBank's SIEM showed increased outbound traffic to unknown domains, but these were flagged as low-priority alerts initially, highlighting the need for improved correlation rules. The company's incident response team contained the breach by isolating affected systems and restoring from backups, though full recovery took approximately 72 hours due to the complexity of the attack chain.",
