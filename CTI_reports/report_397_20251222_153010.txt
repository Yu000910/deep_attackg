On October 15, 2023, SecureBank Inc. detected anomalous activity in its cloud environment, traced back to a sophisticated attack campaign. The organization, a mid-sized bank with operations in North America and Europe, reported unusual network traffic from unknown IP addresses, prompting an investigation. Initial analysis revealed that the adversaries likely purchased SSL certificate data from dark web vendors to map SecureBank's web services and identify vulnerabilities in external-facing assets [T1597.002]. Concurrently, the actors established fake email accounts using personas mimicking legitimate vendors to conduct spearphishing operations targeting IT staff [T1585.002]. They then purchased hosted services from a compromised provider to set up command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, mirroring tactics observed in historical campaigns like Night Dragon [T1583.004]. To enhance stealth, the group acquired Cloudflare Origin CA TLS certificates to encrypt C2 communications, similar to techniques used by Mustang Panda [T1588.004]. Upon gaining initial access via a phishing link, the malware injected malicious code into a PowerShell script (evil.ps1) to compromise software dependencies and steal credentials from memory [T1195.001]. For persistence, the malware registered a systemd timer to execute a cryptocurrency miner upon system startup, ensuring long-term access [T1053.006]. It also wrote COR_PROFILER_PATH to the registry to inject a rogue profiler into managed code execution, evading detection by security tools [T1574.012]. Additionally, a VBScript was placed in the Windows Startup folder for automatic execution upon user login, maintaining foothold [T1037.002]. After execution, the malware forked itself and ran the fork with the '--init' flag to perform secondary cleanup operations, with the parent process terminating to break process trees and hide activity [T1036.009]. The actors then utilized Azure PowerShell cmdlets, such as 'Get-AzKeyVaultSecret', to extract storage account keys from Azure Key Vault, accessing cloud secrets management stores [T1555.006]. For lateral movement, they employed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to pivot between systems within the network [T1021.001]. To evade network monitoring, the backdoor used raw sockets to transmit data directly at the network layer, implementing port knocking techniques [T1205.001]. Finally, as part of the attack's destructive phase, a script wrote pseudorandom bytes to the entire storage volume, wiping disk content and making file recovery impossible [T1561.001]. Logs from SecureBank's SIEM showed increased CPU usage on several servers, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to the stealthy nature of the campaign. The organization's incident response team is currently analyzing artifacts, including registry changes and network traffic patterns, to develop mitigation strategies.
