On March 15, 2024, a fictional financial services company, 'SecureFin Corp.', reported anomalous network activity originating from an employee workstation. Initial investigation revealed that the adversary likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify potential targets, though no specific logs were captured for this phase. The attack began when an employee inserted an infected USB drive into the workstation, allowing the malware to replicate across the network [T1091]. The payload, disguised as a legitimate document, executed JavaScript code [T1059.007] to establish persistence and download additional modules. Subsequently, the malware queried the Windows Registry [T1012] to verify the existence of scheduled tasks while simultaneously discovering cloud infrastructure by querying the DescribeInstances API [T1580] and collecting software information such as .NET and PowerShell versions [T1518]. To maintain access, the actors used stolen web session cookies [T1550.004] to bypass multi-factor authentication on cloud email accounts, and they employed a dead drop resolver via Twitter [T1102.001] to dynamically obtain command-and-control server addresses. Finally, data exfiltration was conducted over unencrypted HTTP protocols using base64 encoding [T1048.003], with logs showing unusual outbound traffic to external IP addresses. SecureFin Corp.'s internal monitoring systems, including SIEM alerts for registry modifications and cloud API calls, provided early detection, though no prior incidents of this scale have been reported in their history.
