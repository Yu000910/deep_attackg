On 2024-09-15, our investigation into a breach at 'TechGlobal Inc.' revealed that adversaries likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] prior to compromising the company's development environment by altering the compiler executable to insert malicious functionality [T1195]. The threat actor then used the default Administrator account to establish persistence on the compromised system [T1078.001] and employed malware that utilized Azure RunCommand to deploy backdoors across virtual machines [T1651] while simultaneously using Windows Bluetooth APIs to discover information on connected Bluetooth devices [T1120]. For lateral movement, the actor used valid network credentials gathered through credential harvesting to move within victim networks, often employing the Impacket framework [T1021], and configured a fake DHCP service to redirect client requests [T1557.003] as part of adversary-in-the-middle activities that included ARP spoofing to capture unencrypted credentials transmitted over the network [T1557]. Data exfiltration involved using commands like 'find E:\ -name "*.xlsx" -type f' to search for Excel spreadsheets containing financial data from removable media [T1025], with communication channels leveraging HTTP and HTTPS protocols [T1071.001] to download additional tools from command-and-control servers [T1105]. The campaign also deployed botnet malware to harness network resources for credential stuffing attacks [T1496.002] and altered the index.html file to display false company announcements about acquisitions [T1491.002]. System logs from TechGlobal Inc. showed normal user activity during the incident, and the company's background in financial software development was unrelated to the attack vectors. Further analysis indicated no impact on unrelated systems, but ongoing monitoring is recommended.
