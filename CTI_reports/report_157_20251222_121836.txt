The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign dubbed 'Operation Honeybee'. Crimson Lotus actors likely conduct reconnaissance by using nmap with OS detection flags to map the target's network topology [T1590.004] and query server banners to identify vulnerabilities in web server versions [T1595.002]. Additionally, they employed DirBuster to scan for exposed administrative interfaces [T1595.003]. For this operation, the threat actors stole a digital signature from Adobe Systems to use with their MaoCheng dropper [T1588.004] and compromised the software supply chain by substituting an authentic compiled release package on a download server with a malicious version containing ransomware components [T1195.002]. Initial infection was achieved through a JavaScript file executed by Gootloader [T1059.007]. System logs from the target environment show routine maintenance activities, such as backup processes running at 02:00 UTC, which are unrelated to the attack. Persistence was established by modifying the HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments\Windows x64\Print Processors\CustomProc\Driver to point to a malicious DLL [T1547.012] and registering malicious.dll as a Windows service for event-triggered execution [T1546]. The malware, identified as a variant of Ursnif, used a domain generation algorithm to dynamically create C2 domains [T1568.002]. Background on the targeted organization, a mid-sized bank with operations in North America, indicates no prior significant breaches, but this simulation highlights critical gaps in their defense posture.
