The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional APT campaign. CrimsonShadow actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] and compromise DNS servers [T1584] to redirect legitimate domains to malicious IPs, while tampering with software compilation pipelines [T1195.002] to inject backdoors into distributed applications. Upon execution, the malware employs PowerShell [T1059.001] to monitor Windows message loops for keyboard input [T1674] and modify Group Policy Objects [T1484.001] to create scheduled tasks for persistence. System logs from infected hosts show routine maintenance activities, but the malware uses wevtutil to disable Windows event logging [T1562.002] and implements sleep functions [T1497.003] to evade detection based on time intervals. During lateral movement, the actors use nltest via scripts [T1482] to discover domain trusts and leverage pass-the-hash techniques [T1550] to authenticate to domain controllers with stolen credential hashes. Network traffic analysis reveals the use of raw sockets for port knocking [T1205.001] to hide command and control communications, while exfiltration occurs over both C2 channels [T1041] and physical media [T1052] such as external hard drives. Finally, the malware inhibits system recovery [T1490] by deleting shadow volumes with vssadmin.exe, complicating restoration efforts. This campaign underscores the need for robust supply chain security and enhanced monitoring of domain trust relationships.
