The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign. Crimson Shadow actors initiated reconnaissance by querying the victim's corporate website to extract client relationship information [T1591.002] and simultaneously searched CT log aggregators to discover newly issued digital certificates for the target's web applications [T1596.003]. Following this, they conducted phishing for information [T1598] by sending fake password reset emails, which security analysts collected for investigation. The actors then staged capabilities [T1608] using controlled servers to validate tracking pixels sent to phishing victims, while deploying a drive-by target [T1608.004] by writing malicious.js to the website's scripts directory to execute payloads upon user visits. For initial access, they abused Azure Managed Identities to maintain persistent access to cloud key vaults [T1078.004], leveraging inter-process communication [T1559] to pipe command output to targeted processes. During lateral movement, the threat actors used PDQ Deploy as a software deployment tool [T1072] to distribute AvosLocker and other tools across the network, and installed a rogue DLL as a server software component [T1505] on the web server. Persistence was achieved by writing a registry key under HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components to run on each user login [T1547.014]. For discovery, the malware performed application window discovery [T1010] to identify and close windows on controlled systems, and executed 'gpresult /z' for group policy discovery [T1615] to display all available Group Policy information. Prior to exfiltration, data was archived via utility [T1560.001] using WinZip, and screen capture [T1113] capabilities were employed to take JPEG screenshots. Exfiltration involved using web services [T1102] like Dropbox, Amazon S3, and Google Drive to host malicious downloads, while protocol tunneling [T1572] abused DoH protocols to conceal DNS queries. A script utilized the Dropbox API to transfer data to cloud accounts [T1537], and a zero-day vulnerability in the database management system was exploited for application or system exploitation [T1499.004] to trigger memory leaks and instability. Logs from the victim's SIEM showed increased network traffic to external IPs, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to encrypted payloads. The company, a mid-sized financial firm, reported unusual system slowdowns during peak hours, which were initially attributed to routine maintenance.
