On 2023-10-15, security analysts at a fictional energy company, GridPower Inc., detected anomalous network activity originating from an employee workstation. GridPower Inc., a mid-sized utility provider operating in the Northeastern United States, reported unusual outbound traffic patterns during routine log reviews, which triggered an investigation. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify high-value targets, though specific details are omitted for training purposes. Initial access was achieved through spearphishing emails [T1566] that contained malicious links [T1598.003] mimicking corporate single sign-on portals, leading to credential harvesting pages. Concurrently, phishing emails with infected ZIP file attachments [T1566] were used to distribute ransomware payloads across the network, exploiting user trust and weak email filtering. Upon execution, the adversary employed AutoHotKey scripts [T1059.010] to automate keystroke logging and data exfiltration, while establishing command and control (C2) channels using FakeTLS [T1001.003] to impersonate legitimate HTTPS traffic and evade detection. System logs from the compromised workstation showed increased CPU usage and failed authentication attempts, though these were initially dismissed as minor anomalies. In later stages, the malware deployed disk structure wipes [T1561.002] to destroy partition information including MBR and GPT entries, rendering systems unbootable. Additionally, firmware corruption [T1495] was executed via a modified bootloader to prevent normal system startup, causing prolonged operational downtime. The attack culminated in data encryption and exfiltration, with ransom demands issued via encrypted channels. Background checks revealed no prior incidents at GridPower Inc., but industry-wide alerts had been issued for similar tactics. Response teams contained the breach within 72 hours, but recovery efforts were hampered by the destructive components.
