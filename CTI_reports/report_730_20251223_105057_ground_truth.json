    "clean_text": "Crimson Tempest likely conducted reconnaissance by scanning network security appliances to gather victim host information, while simultaneously acquiring scalable cloud infrastructure to deploy phishing sites. The actors exploited a vulnerable public-facing web application for initial access, then employed AWS Systems Manager commands to execute lateral movement across cloud environments while modifying the Security Support Provider registry key to load a credential harvesting DLL. Persistence was established by configuring installer packages to run custom executables, and the adversary extracted cached domain credentials from LSASS memory while enumerating local accounts using NetUserEnum. Network service discovery was performed via port scanning to identify additional targets, and the malware implemented virtualization evasion by sleeping between C2 attempts to avoid sandbox detection. Data exfiltration involved using IDE tunneling to bypass network controls, with C2 traffic encoded in Base64 and exfiltrated over unencrypted HTTP protocols by splitting files into chunks to avoid size limits, while a network sniffer captured transmitted authentication credentials for manipulation. System logs from the victim's firewall showed routine traffic spikes unrelated to the attack, and the organization's background in financial services provided no direct correlation to the intrusion vector.",

The campaign involves reconnaissance, exploitation of public-facing applications, credential harvesting, lateral movement, and data exfiltration, leveraging techniques such as cloud administration commands and virtualization evasion to evade detection. This report is intended for blue team training to enhance defensive capabilities against similar tactics.",
