The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional APT campaign. Crimson Shadow actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] by scanning public-facing assets and gathering employee information from social media. The attack began with initial access via a compromised USB drive inserted into an employee workstation at a manufacturing company, exploiting the Windows AUTORUN feature to replicate malware across removable media [T1091]. System logs from the workstation show unusual process creation events around 09:15 UTC on 2023-10-05, but no immediate alerts were triggered. Following execution, the actors employed vSphere Web Services SDK commands [T1675] to remotely execute arbitrary PowerShell scripts on guest virtual machines (VMs) in the ESXi environment, enabling lateral movement within the on-premises network. Concurrently, they used Azure Runbooks via cloud APIs [T1059.009] to deploy backdoors in the Azure tenant, establishing persistence in the cloud environment while bypassing macOS Gatekeeper protections [T1553.001] by writing malicious executables to the Downloads folder without user warnings on compromised Mac endpoints. Network traffic analysis revealed adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) attacks [T1557] where proxies were set up to monitor and alter HTTP(S) traffic between internal servers and external services, facilitating credential theft. Additionally, the backdoor communicated with command-and-control (C2) servers over DNS protocols [T1071.004] to exfiltrate stolen data, blending with normal network activity. The company, a mid-sized firm with operations in North America and Europe, reported no significant downtime, but incident response teams identified anomalies during a routine audit. Defensive recommendations include disabling AUTORUN, monitoring virtualization admin tools, restricting cloud API permissions, enabling Gatekeeper, inspecting network traffic for proxies, and analyzing DNS logs for unusual patterns.
