On 2023-10-15, GlobalRetail Inc., a multinational retailer with operations in over 50 countries, reported anomalous network traffic originating from its e-commerce platform. Initial analysis revealed that the threat actor, CrimsonViper, likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify high-traffic product pages. The actors then employed SEO poisoning [T1608.006] by injecting hidden div elements with popular product names into the website's HTML to redirect users to malicious domains, while simultaneously compromising the software supply chain [T1195.002] by tampering with the compilation pipeline of a third-party inventory management application to inject malicious code into distributed updates. Upon execution, the malicious payload leveraged system services [T1569] through svchost.exe to bypass application whitelisting and establish persistence, and it performed TCC manipulation [T1548.006] by resetting the TCC database in a loop to gain unauthorized access to user folders like Desktop and Downloads. The adversary further exploited path interception by search order hijacking [T1574.008] to load malicious DLLs from manipulated directories, and they modified Group Policy [T1484.001] using a customized PowerShell script to deploy scheduled tasks for lateral movement across the network. For lateral movement, the actors hijacked RDP sessions [T1563.002] using tscon.exe to take control of established administrative connections, and they set up an internal proxy [T1090.001] to relay network traffic through compromised agents to evade detection. Finally, to maintain redundant access, CrimsonViper abused a PiKVM device [T1219.003] as remote access hardware to control critical infrastructure systems, ensuring operational continuity even if primary methods were disrupted. Throughout the incident, system logs from GlobalRetail's SIEM showed increased failed login attempts from IP addresses in Eastern Europe, though these were unrelated to the core attack chain and likely part of routine noise. The company's background includes a recent merger with a smaller competitor, which may have introduced unpatched vulnerabilities in integrated systems.
