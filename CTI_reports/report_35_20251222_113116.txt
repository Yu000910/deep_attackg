The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams about a fictional APT campaign designed for training purposes. This report is based on simulated activity and includes realistic noise to enhance detection skills. Background: The targeted organization, a mid-sized financial services firm with offices in New York and London, reported unusual network slowdowns starting last week, but initial logs showed no immediate threats. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by performing an nmap scan against the organization's public web servers to map their IP infrastructure [T1590.005]. Following this, the continuous integration server was modified to include credential-stealing malware in production builds, exploiting a known vulnerability in the Jenkins plugin [T1195]. Once deployed, the malware used 'systemctl enable command-control' to ensure continuous communication with C2 servers while simultaneously executing PowerShell.exe to locate Kerberos session keys in system memory [T1569.003, T1558.004]. The tool CrossRAT, identified in memory dumps, is capable of taking screen captures to exfiltrate sensitive data [T1113]. Network traffic analysis revealed encrypted communications using RSA, consistent with Dridex variants, to obscure command and control activities [T1573.002]. Finally, the malicious payload overwrote critical boot sector files with corrupted data, causing the system to fail during startup, which was detected during routine maintenance checks [T1561.002]. Additional logs from firewall systems showed normal user activity during this period, but no further anomalies were flagged.
