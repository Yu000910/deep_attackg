    "clean_text": "On October 26, 2023, analysts at a major financial institution detected anomalous network activity, prompting an investigation that revealed a multi-stage intrusion campaign. The threat actor, designated as 'CrimsonShadow', likely began by conducting automated reconnaissance, querying the corporate website to extract employee directory information and sending ICMP echo requests to map the organization's network topology. System logs from the perimeter firewall showed increased traffic to external IPs, though no immediate alerts were triggered. The actor then leveraged a paid threat intelligence feed to gather intelligence on employee email patterns, correlating this with publicly available social media data to identify high-value targets. Background checks revealed that the institution had recently migrated to a cloud-based infrastructure, but this was unrelated to the attack. Following reconnaissance, CrimsonShadow developed custom capabilities, writing a keylogger malware.exe to capture sensitive user credentials and improving on existing tools by creating the Mango backdoor for persistent access. The initial access phase involved spearphishing, where a malicious Microsoft document attachment was sent to targeted employees, delivering a payload that, upon user execution by opening the file, triggered a Base64-encoded PowerShell script injected to enumerate and steal database connection strings. User logs indicated that one employee interacted with a fake CAPTCHA, following instructions to paste and execute the script via the Windows Run window. Once inside, the actor exploited vulnerabilities, using MS14-068 to create forged Kerberos tickets and impersonate domain administrators while simultaneously querying useraccount details with WMIC to identify administrative privileges. Lateral movement was achieved through pass the hash techniques on compromised x64 machines and using WinRM commands to remotely modify firewall settings, with the backdoor establishing redundant communication pathways via 'remote_access_tool.exe'. Persistence was maintained by manipulating plist files to execute a data exfiltration tool upon user login. Finally, exfiltration occurred over alternative protocols, with the backdoor collecting system configuration files and transmitting them using NetBIOS over TCP/IP to an attacker-controlled server. Network monitoring tools flagged unusual outbound traffic, but initial triage misattributed it to routine backups.",
