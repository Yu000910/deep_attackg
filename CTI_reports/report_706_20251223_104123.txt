The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform organizations about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the fictional threat actor 'SilentEcho'. This report is based on a simulated attack scenario for educational training of blue teams. SilentEcho likely conducted reconnaissance by collecting publicly available contact information from professional networking sites [T1593.001] and accessing private data broker services to acquire sensitive corporate information about targets [T1597]. In a sophisticated social engineering phase, the adversary placed a concealed recording device in an executive's office to collect voice data during strategic meetings [T1598.004]. Initial access was achieved through a supply chain compromise where malicious code was injected into a popular open-source library dependency used by thousands of applications [T1195], followed by exploiting vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure VPNs to hijack sessions [T1190]. Execution involved using 'launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/malware.plist' to run malicious code as a system service [T1569.001]. Collection activities included invoking Outlook.exe programmatically to gather email metadata and contact lists [T1114]. For command and control, data was encoded using base64 -d to bypass security monitoring [T1001]. Exfiltration was conducted over Bluetooth RFCOMM channels to transfer stolen financial records [T1011.001]. System logs from the target environment showed routine network traffic spikes, but no alerts were triggered during the initial phases. The targeted organization, a mid-sized financial firm, reported no prior incidents, highlighting the stealth of this simulated attack.
