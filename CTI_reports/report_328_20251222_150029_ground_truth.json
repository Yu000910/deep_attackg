    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group 'ShadowVeil'. This report is based on a training scenario designed for blue team exercises. On 2024-10-01, a mid-sized technology firm, TechNova Inc., reported anomalous activity in its virtualized infrastructure. TechNova, headquartered in San Francisco with 500 employees, specializes in cloud-based software solutions. Initial investigation revealed that the actors likely conducted reconnaissance by querying the organization's public blog for author names and bylines to identify potential targets. Subsequently, the malware exploited the default Administrator password 'admin123' on an exposed management interface to gain initial access. Once inside, the adversary employed the Hypervisor CLI to execute commands such as 'esxcli storage filesystem list', gathering detailed information about available datastores and storage systems while simultaneously running system checks to detect processor and register characteristics, evading emulation and analysis. System logs from 2024-10-02 show multiple failed login attempts from IP 192.168.1.100, which were unrelated to this incident. The actors then escalated privileges by using a malicious script to add the Global Administrator role to a compromised user account in the cloud environment. For command and control (C2), DustySky, a known fictional malware variant, utilized both HTTP and HTTPS protocols to communicate with external servers, blending traffic with legitimate web requests. Additional noise includes routine backup logs from 03:00 UTC showing no errors. The campaign aimed at exfiltrating sensitive data, though no actual data loss occurred in this training scenario. Organizations are advised to review default account settings and monitor hypervisor CLI usage.",
