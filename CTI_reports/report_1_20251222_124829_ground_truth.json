    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to warn of a fictional APT campaign observed between January and March 2024. Crimson Shadow actors likely conduct reconnaissance by embedding IP-grabbing scripts in phishing emails to collect victim location data. In one incident, a business email compromise (BEC) attempt at a mid-sized software firm, 'TechNova Inc.', led to the initial access via a malicious attachment. The actors then exploited a supply chain vulnerability by modifying the build automation tool, Jenkins, to include a backdoor in compiled software updates distributed to customers. This allowed them to inject malicious content into network traffic, redirecting user sessions through a compromised ISP channel to a malicious proxy for data exfiltration. Once inside the virtual environment, the adversaries abused ESXi administration commands, specifically StartProgramInGuest, to launch persistence mechanisms within guest virtual machines while simultaneously hijacking registry permissions by targeting HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Themes to establish long-term access. System logs from TechNova's VMware vCenter server showed unusual activity at 03:45 UTC, including failed login attempts from IP address 192.168.1.105, which was later identified as a compromised internal host. The malware then scanned the /proc/ directory to identify running processes for injection targets and leveraged Google Chrome Remote Desktop to maintain interactive control over compromised systems. As part of the impact phase, the botnet generated massive ICMP echo requests from thousands of compromised devices, causing network denial of service, and encrypted victim filesystems using ChaCha20 and ChaCha8 stream ciphers for financial extortion. Background checks revealed that TechNova had recently updated its firewall policies, but misconfigurations allowed lateral movement. No actual data loss occurred in this training scenario, but the simulation highlights critical vulnerabilities in virtual infrastructure management.",
