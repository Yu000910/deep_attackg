    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide information on a fictional APT campaign attributed to 'Windshift'. This campaign targets a critical infrastructure organization in the energy sector, with the goal of disrupting operations and exfiltrating sensitive data. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance to identify vulnerabilities in web-facing systems. Initial access was achieved through a drive-by compromise, where employees visited a compromised website that registered custom URL schemes on their systems. Following this, the adversary executed a Lua script to kill security-related processes and clear event logs, while simultaneously using PowerShell to download and execute additional payloads on the infected machine. System logs from the compromised host show unusual network traffic to external IP addresses, but no alerts were triggered due to misconfigured firewall rules. The organization, 'EnergyGrid Corp', has a history of legacy systems and limited security monitoring, which may have facilitated the attack. The actors then leveraged compromised infrastructure to execute container administration commands, such as 'docker exec production_container iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP', to disrupt SSH access and hinder response efforts. For persistence, they employed template injection by altering a docx file to contain an embedded script that connects to a command and control server. The attacker used Set-ADUser to modify the msRADIUSFramedIPAddress attribute on a domain account, implementing reversible encryption to obscure credential storage. Lateral movement was achieved through password cracking, where the threat actor systematically collected switch configuration files to obtain and crack password hashes, while using process discovery to retrieve a list of running processes from compromised machines and identify security tools. Network logs indicate repeated failed login attempts across multiple servers, but these were not investigated promptly. The campaign demonstrates a sophisticated blend of techniques aimed at evading detection and maintaining access within the environment.",
