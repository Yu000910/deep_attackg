CrimsonWraith actors initiated their campaign by conducting reconnaissance to gather information on target infrastructure. They queried Shodan [T1596.005] to identify FTP servers with anonymous login enabled within the organization's IP blocks, while simultaneously using systeminfo.exe to extract firmware data as part of host enumeration [T1592.003]. Following initial access via an FTP server, the adversary employed Mimikatz.exe to dump credential material from the LSASS process memory [T1078.003] and used HyperStack to connect to IPC$ shares on remote machines using default credentials [T1078.001]. For execution and persistence, the attacker used 'launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/malware.plist' to execute malicious code as a system service [T1569.001] and leveraged Cobalt Strike to load DLLs via reflective injection [T1055.001] while malware executed klist to enumerate available Kerberos service tickets in memory [T1558]. In the data collection phase, a malicious script launched Outlook.exe to access and copy sensitive email attachments [T1114] and employed bash scripts to save harvested credentials to a hidden folder before exfiltration [T1074]. Finally, the malware established covert command and control channels using MQTT publish/subscribe messages [T1071.005]. System logs from the affected Windows Server 2019 instances showed unusual spikes in network traffic at 03:00 UTC, coinciding with scheduled maintenance windows, though no actual data loss occurred in this training scenario. The organization, a mid-sized utility provider in the Midwest, reported no operational impact, but the simulation highlights vulnerabilities in legacy FTP configurations and insufficient monitoring of service account activities.
