APT-FINX initiated reconnaissance by querying public DNS records [T1590.003] to identify subdomains and understand organizational network segmentation, while simultaneously using the GetUserRealm API [T1590.001] to collect domain properties and determine authentication requirements. The malware then leveraged a cloud service provider's free trial [T1584.003] to establish temporary command and control infrastructure, and the attacker modified the build automation tool [T1195] to include a backdoor in the compiled software. During execution, the malware dynamically loaded a malicious DLL using the LoadLibrary function [T1129] to execute its payload, and in compromised containers, it collected API access tokens from environment variables [T1528]. For lateral movement, malicious scripts were used to query Smart Install clients [T1602.002] for network topology information, and the threat actor leveraged HTTP Referer headers [T1001.003] to transmit encoded command data. Exfiltration involved the backdoor encrypting collected system information using RC4 [T1048.001] for covert transmission, while it automatically collected sensitive_docs.zip containing financial records from the shared network drive [T1020], and the attacker deployed a network sniffer to intercept unencrypted FTP credentials transmitted across the network [T1565.002]. System logs from the affected servers showed routine maintenance activities unrelated to the attack, and the targeted organization, a mid-sized bank, had recently updated its firewall policies without incident.
