    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide insights into the fictional APT group 'CloudShadow', which has been observed in training scenarios targeting entities in the financial and technology sectors. The group operates with moderate sophistication, focusing on data theft and persistence in cloud environments. Background: The simulated attack occurred at 'FinTech Global Inc.', a company with Azure cloud services and on-premises SQL servers, where routine logs showed increased authentication attempts from unrecognized IP ranges, though these were initially dismissed as false positives. In the Initial Access phase, the actors likely conducted reconnaissance to identify misconfigured cloud resources, then abused Azure Managed Identities to gain persistent access to cloud storage, bypassing multi-factor authentication. Execution involved writing an AppleScript payload to the Documents folder that downloaded and executed additional malware while simultaneously leveraging SQL stored procedures like xp_cmdshell to run commands on the database server. For Command and Control, the malware encoded communications with a base64 algorithm using a custom alphabet to evade signature-based detection, and data was exfiltrated by uploading user documents to a text storage service while configuring the tool to transfer files at a specified rate to avoid network thresholds. System logs from FinTech Global showed unusual spikes in outbound traffic to cloud storage endpoints, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to normal business operations. This campaign highlights the need for enhanced monitoring of cloud identities and SQL server activities.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by a fictional APT group, 'CloudShadow', which targets organizations with hybrid cloud and on-premises infrastructure. The campaign involves initial access through cloud account abuse, execution via scripting and SQL procedures, command and control using non-standard encoding, and data exfiltration to evade detection. This report is for educational purposes to train blue teams on identifying and mitigating such tactics.",
