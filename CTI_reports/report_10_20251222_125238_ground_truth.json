    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to document a simulated advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign, designated 'Operation MidnightEclipse', for training and awareness purposes. This fictional scenario is based on observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in real-world incidents to enhance defensive capabilities. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance by gathering information on target organizations, though specific details are omitted for brevity. Initial access was achieved through the use of compromised domain admin accounts, which were obtained via phishing campaigns not detailed in this report. System logs from the victim environment show unusual login attempts from external IP addresses during off-hours, but these were initially dismissed as false positives due to misconfigured monitoring tools. The company, a mid-sized financial services firm with hybrid cloud infrastructure, reported no prior significant breaches, making this simulated attack a critical learning opportunity for their security team. Upon gaining access, the adversary employed the at.exe utility to schedule execution of a malicious PowerShell script for 2 AM, while simultaneously modifying the AllUsersCurrentHost PowerShell profile to embed reconnaissance commands that run upon each session start. This allowed for persistent access and automated data collection. For further execution and evasion, the threat actors leveraged CMSTP.exe with a malicious INF file to deploy a payload similar to POWERSTATS, bypassing application whitelisting controls. Discovery activities included querying cloud APIs such as DescribeInstances to enumerate compute resources and using 'az ad user list' commands to export all Azure Active Directory user objects, including display names and user principal names, facilitating targeted lateral movement. Network traffic analysis revealed that the actors established telnet sessions to network switches using valid domain credentials, enabling manipulation of network configurations and further access to segmented systems. Command and control was maintained through fast flux DNS techniques, where the backdoor registered multiple DNS A records with short TTL values for dynamic and resilient communication with C2 servers. Data exfiltration involved automated queuing of files sent to C2 in compressed and obfuscated packets, while transmitted data was manipulated to alter unencrypted database queries containing customer personally identifiable information (PII), as captured by network sniffers. Incident responders noted that the attack leveraged existing domain trust relationships, highlighting the need for robust credential management and monitoring of cloud and on-premises environments.",
