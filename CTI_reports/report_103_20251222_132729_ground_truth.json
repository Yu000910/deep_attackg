    "clean_text": "On 2024-10-15, GlobalTech Solutions, a company with annual revenue of $2 billion and offices in New York and London, reported anomalous network traffic from its public-facing customer portal, which runs on an outdated version of Apache Struts. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance to identify this vulnerability, then exploited it to gain initial access into the victim network. Once inside, they used Azure Virtual Machine extensions via Cloud API to execute PowerShell scripts that installed cryptocurrency mining software while simultaneously modifying executable installer file permissions in the Program Files folder to gain administrative execution rights. To maintain persistence, the malware modified Mach-O binaries on macOS systems by adding LC_LOAD_DYLIB commands to reference malicious dylibs, and for defense evasion, it set the HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\CrashControl\\CrashDumpEnabled Registry key to 0 to disable crash dumps while exploiting CVE-2024-20399 in Cisco Switches to escape the NX-OS command line interface and gain access to the underlying operating system for arbitrary command execution. For lateral movement, the actors used RPC backdoors to transfer tools between victim machines on the local network, and they staged collected data locally in .nfo files. System logs from 10:30 AM UTC showed increased CPU usage on server AZ-VM-001, but no alerts were triggered due to misconfigured thresholds. For command and control, the malware dynamically registered new DNS A records using fast flux DNS to point to its C2 server, and it established bidirectional communication via GitHub and a public blog service in Hong Kong. Finally, the attacker exfiltrated stolen credentials by storing them in a gist via the GitHub API. The incident was contained after 48 hours, with no data loss reported, but recovery efforts are ongoing as per internal memos from the IT department.",

The activity was observed in a fictional multinational corporation, 'GlobalTech Solutions', with operations in finance and healthcare sectors, and involved lateral movement, data staging, and exfiltration via code repositories. Blue teams should review logs for unusual PowerShell executions in Azure environments, registry modifications, and unexpected DNS changes.",
