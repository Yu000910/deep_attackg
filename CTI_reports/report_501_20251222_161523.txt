AzurePhantom likely began by conducting reconnaissance on target organizations, focusing on employees with access to sensitive cloud and email systems. The actors then used stolen legitimate credentials [T1078] to gain initial access to corporate email accounts, hijacking communications to spread malicious links. Upon user interaction, the adversary employed AppleScript [T1059.002] on macOS systems to create login items for persistence while simultaneously using PowerShell on Windows to download additional payloads [T1105] from command-and-control servers. In cloud environments, the malware executed Azure CLI commands to assign elevated permissions via 'az role assignment create' [T1098.001], and it compiled and registered a malicious MOF file using mofcomp.exe for WMI event subscription persistence [T1546.003]. For lateral movement, AzurePhantom abused legitimate executables to side-load weaponized DLLs through search order hijacking [T1574.001] and created a CronJob in Kubernetes clusters to periodically execute a container that harvests credentials from other pods [T1053.007]. To weaken security, the ransomware altered system firmware to downgrade encryption protocols [T1600.002], and after initial execution, the malware forked itself with the '--init' flag to break process trees [T1036.009], allowing clean-up operations. The actors also scanned Slack Workflow definitions to locate exposed AWS access keys in chat messages [T1552.008] and used screen capture tools [T1113] to monitor user activity. Finally, collected email archives were encrypted using AES-192 and exfiltrated over SMTP [T1048.001]. System logs from affected endpoints showed unusual network traffic spikes, and background checks revealed the targeted company had recently migrated to a hybrid cloud setup, though this was not directly exploited in the attack chain.
