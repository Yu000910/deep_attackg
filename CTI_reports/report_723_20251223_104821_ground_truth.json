    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to detail a simulated campaign by a fictional threat actor, 'Volatile Cedar', targeting financial institutions. This report is based on a fictional scenario designed for blue team training and does not reflect real-world events. The campaign began with reconnaissance activities, where actors likely queried the company's 'About Us' page to collect employee names and used tools like DirBuster and GoBuster to brute force web directories and DNS subdomains. Following this, the actors gained initial access by leveraging valid accounts and delivering a malicious Excel file that, when opened, downloaded and executed Black Basta ransomware. Upon execution, the malware compiled and loaded a malicious MOF file into the WMI repository using mofcomp.exe to establish persistence, while simultaneously employing keylogging capabilities to capture credentials and using external proxies like FLIPSIDE to maintain access and create backup RDP tunnels for command and control. System logs from the victim's environment show routine network traffic and failed login attempts, which were initially dismissed as noise. The company, a mid-sized bank with operations in North America, reported no prior incidents, but internal audits revealed gaps in endpoint monitoring. Finally, data exfiltration was performed by writing proprietary source code to a USB flash drive, with actors exploiting physical access during off-hours. This campaign underscores the importance of multi-layered defense strategies, including monitoring for unusual WMI activity and restricting physical media usage.",

This report provides a realistic scenario for blue team training, illustrating reconnaissance, initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, credential access, command and control, and exfiltration techniques. Actors likely conducted reconnaissance to gather employee names and brute force web directories, used valid accounts and malicious files for access and execution, established persistence via WMI event subscriptions, employed keylogging for credential theft, utilized external proxies for command and control, and exfiltrated data over physical media. Organizations are advised to review this advisory to enhance detection and response capabilities.",
