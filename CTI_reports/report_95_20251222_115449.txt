The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional APT campaign, 'Night Dragon', which has been observed targeting multiple sectors, including technology and finance. The campaign begins with reconnaissance activities, where threat actors likely conduct open-source intelligence gathering to identify potential targets. Initial access was achieved by creating a fake Office 365 login page to harvest credentials from targeted employees [T1586.003], while simultaneously distributing spearphishing emails with malicious attachments, such as 'Flagpro.exe', to compromise endpoints [T1566.001]. During the execution phase, the adversary employed custom-developed malware, including a keylogger named 'malware.exe' written to capture sensitive user credentials [T1587], which dynamically loaded malicious DLLs using the LoadLibrary function to execute its payload [T1129]. Persistence was established by modifying Outlook rules to automate malicious actions [T1137.005] and dropping a backdoor DLL called 'prnport.dll' into the system drivers directory to maintain access via port monitors [T1547.010]. In Linux environments, the exploit executed 'sudo -l' to list allowed commands without password verification, exploiting sudo caching mechanisms [T1548.003], and in containerized systems, the attacker modified RoleBinding.yaml files to grant persistent access to compromised service accounts [T1098.006]. The campaign involved a supply chain compromise where the development environment was infiltrated by modifying the compiler to insert trojanized binaries into software updates [T1195]. Command and control (C2) was facilitated through encrypted WebSocket connections to hide traffic within web applications [T1573], with threat actors purchasing hosted services to use as C2 servers [T1583.004]. Exfiltration occurred over these C2 channels, where collected data and files were uploaded from compromised hosts to the adversary's servers [T1041]. Finally, the malware included capabilities to wipe accessible physical or logical drives of infected machines, as seen with tools like 'StoneDrill' [T1561.001]. System logs from affected organizations show increased network traffic to unknown IP addresses, but no significant disruptions were reported during this simulated incident. The company background involves a mid-sized tech firm with hybrid cloud infrastructure, though these details are not directly related to the attack techniques.
