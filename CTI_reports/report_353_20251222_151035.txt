The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaign attributed to 'Silent Librarian'. This actor has historically targeted research and educational institutions, but recent simulations indicate expansion into critical infrastructure sectors like energy and healthcare. Initial reconnaissance involved collecting employee names [T1589.003] from public sources such as LinkedIn and organizational websites, which were used to craft targeted attacks. On 2023-10-15, system logs from a mid-sized utility company showed anomalous DNS queries to 'update-server.com', but no immediate alerts were triggered. The adversary then conducted spearphishing via phone calls [T1566.004], impersonating IT support to persuade a user into downloading and executing a malicious TeamViewer executable, which leveraged Visual Basic scripts [T1059.005] to bypass security controls and establish initial access. Once inside the network, the actor exploited default Guest accounts [T1078.001] on multiple workstations, using PsExec.exe uploaded to a file share [T1608.002] to deploy tools laterally while employing Parent PID Spoofing [T1134.004] via CreateProcess API calls to execute svchost.exe and hide malicious processes from detection. The campaign further utilized Remote Services [T1021] with valid domain credentials to establish telnet sessions to network switches, enabling Video Capture [T1125] of screen content in AVI format for data exfiltration, and implemented Fast Flux DNS [T1568.001] by dynamically registering new DNS A records for 'update-server.com' to maintain covert command-and-control channels. Background checks revealed the company had recently migrated to a cloud-based email system, but legacy systems remained unpatched. Analysis of firewall logs indicated intermittent connections to IP addresses in Eastern Europe, though these were not blocked due to misconfigured rules. This simulation underscores the importance of user training, regular account audits, and network segmentation to mitigate such threats.
