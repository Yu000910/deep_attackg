This actor initiated reconnaissance by scanning the target network's topology and used LinkedIn profiles to identify key employees at GlobalFinCorp, a firm with offices in New York and London focusing on asset management. Following this, the actor exploited password reuse to compromise domain accounts and abused a patch management system to deploy malicious payloads across the network. During execution, the adversary renamed legitimate utilities like certutil to evade detection while capturing GUI inputs through fake authentication prompts and taking screen captures of sensitive financial data. For command and control, the actor employed non-application layer protocols using TCP and UDP, and exfiltrated data over symmetric encrypted non-C2 protocols by encrypting archives with AES before transfer. Additionally, the campaign involved compute hijacking by exploiting unsecured Kubernetes APIs to deploy cryptocurrency mining pods, as observed in logs from the DevOps team showing unusual resource spikes. This scenario is purely educational and based on simulated techniques.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by the fictional threat actor 'Cobalt Serpent' targeting a multinational financial services firm, 'GlobalFinCorp'. The campaign demonstrates a multi-stage attack leveraging reconnaissance, credential theft, lateral movement, and data exfiltration for blue team training purposes. Techniques include network scanning, social engineering, abuse of software deployment tools, and encryption for stealthy exfiltration.",
