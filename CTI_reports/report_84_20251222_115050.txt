The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign designated 'ShadowRouter'. This campaign simulates realistic attack techniques against critical infrastructure, incorporating noise such as irrelevant system logs and background on a fictional manufacturing company, 'GlobalTech Industries', to enhance training realism. Initial Access: The actors likely exploited default credentials on a SOHO router [T1584.008] to gain persistent backdoor access into the network perimeter, while simultaneously conducting a drive-by compromise by injecting malicious JavaScript into an ad network, causing browser.exe to execute unwanted processes [T1189]. Execution: Upon gaining access, the adversary employed a command-line interpreter [T1059] to execute malicious scripts and deployed a container using 'docker create' to initialize a persistent, embedded backdoor [T1610]. Persistence: To maintain access, the actors modified PERSONAL.XLSB with a macro that runs automatically [T1137.001] and altered HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\SCRNSAVE.exe to a malicious script that activates with the screensaver [T1546.002]. Privilege Escalation: The threat actor injected malicious code into running processes to gain higher privileges and evade detection [T1055]. Defense Evasion: After executing reconnaissance commands, the adversary ran 'history -c' to clear command history and obscure their activities [T1070.003]. Credential Access: A password filter DLL was registered on domain controllers as a Windows LSA password filter to capture credentials during logins or password changes [T1556.002]. Discovery: The malware ran 'az ad user get-member-groups' to enumerate cloud security groups [T1069.003] and utilized 'esxcli software vib list' to discover virtual machine components [T1673]. Lateral Movement: The actors used RAdmin, a remote software deployment tool, to control workstations [T1072] and established SSH connections to remote services for further access [T1021.004]. Collection: A malicious PowerShell command generated a fake credential prompt mimicking corporate VPN software to capture GUI input [T1056.002], while the threat actor queried Google Chat APIs to extract shared documents with sensitive information [T1213.005] and automated the search for stored credentials associated with cryptocurrency wallets, notifying the C2 server upon identification [T1119]. Command and Control: EvilBunny executed C2 commands directly via HTTP for communication [T1071.001]. Additional noise: System logs from GlobalTech Industries showed routine network traffic unrelated to the attack, and background information indicated the company specializes in industrial automation with no prior major security incidents.
