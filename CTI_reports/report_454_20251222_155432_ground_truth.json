    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight a fictional APT campaign, 'ShadowVeil,' designed for blue team training. This report outlines a realistic attack scenario based on observed techniques in simulated exercises. Initial reconnaissance involved actors conducting a drive-by download that exploited a heap overflow in the browser to access and transmit host configuration information, while simultaneously querying public data breach repositories to find compromised credentials. The attack began with spearphishing emails containing malicious Excel attachments, which, when opened, executed VBA macros to display a dialog box and collect victim credentials. Upon execution, the malware placed a trojanized dylib in a writable directory with higher search precedence to hijack legitimate processes and injected malicious.dll into the memory space of a running browser process using extra window memory injection to evade detection. System checks were performed to determine if the malware was running in a sandbox environment by verifying the hard drive size; if detected, it would delete itself by overwriting malware scripts with the contents of 'License.txt' and exiting. After establishing persistence, the actors used pass the hash techniques on compromised machines with x64 versions to move laterally and employed metaMain to download additional tools onto compromised systems. Communications with the command-and-control (C2) server were encrypted using AES in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode padded with PKCS5 for symmetric cryptography. Data exfiltration was conducted in small, inconspicuous chunks via scheduled transfers using PowerShell scripts, and proprietary source code was written to a removable USB drive for exfiltration over physical medium. Logs from the affected systems showed routine network traffic spikes during off-hours, unrelated to the attack, and the company's background includes a recent merger with a smaller fintech firm, which expanded its digital footprint. No actual data loss occurred in this training scenario.",
