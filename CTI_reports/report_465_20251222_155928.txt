On 2024-10-05, security analysts at a fictional manufacturing company, 'GlobalTech Industries', detected anomalous activity in their Azure environment. The company, which produces industrial automation systems, maintains a hybrid infrastructure with on-premises servers and cloud-based virtual machines (VMs) for customer data processing. Initial logs showed unusual network scans originating from an external IP address, later traced to a compromised developer account. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by searching public code repositories like GitHub for exposed API keys and credentials [T1593.003], then used vulnerability scanning tools to query service banners across the network, identifying unpatched systems running outdated web services [T1595.002]. This led to the discovery of a default Guest account on an internal server with blank password credentials, which the adversary exploited to gain initial access [T1078.001]. Once inside, they employed Azure RunCommand to execute malicious scripts on cloud VMs, exfiltrating sensitive customer data [T1651] while using bash commands to add a persistent backdoor to the system [T1059]. To maintain persistence and credential access, the attacker dropped a malicious DLL into the System32 directory to intercept authentication credentials via network provider hooks [T1556.008] and leveraged a malicious Word document designed to force authentication and extract LSASS memory for hashes using PowerShell scripts [T1187]. The adversary then established remote access via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions to move laterally across the network [T1021.001], while using junk data techniques by retrieving non-existent webpages from command and control servers to parse commands from error logs, obfuscating communication with a web shell [T1001.001]. Finally, they exfiltrated harvested database records to a text-sharing platform for external retrieval [T1567.003]. System logs from the affected VMs showed increased CPU usage and unusual outbound traffic to unknown domains, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured monitoring tools.
