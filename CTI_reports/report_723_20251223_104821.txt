The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to detail a simulated campaign by a fictional threat actor, 'Volatile Cedar', targeting financial institutions. This report is based on a fictional scenario designed for blue team training and does not reflect real-world events. The campaign began with reconnaissance activities, where actors likely queried the company's 'About Us' page to collect employee names [T1589.003] and used tools like DirBuster and GoBuster to brute force web directories and DNS subdomains [T1595.003]. Following this, the actors gained initial access by leveraging valid accounts [T1078] and delivering a malicious Excel file that, when opened, downloaded and executed Black Basta ransomware [T1204.002]. Upon execution, the malware compiled and loaded a malicious MOF file into the WMI repository using mofcomp.exe to establish persistence [T1546.003], while simultaneously employing keylogging capabilities [T1056.001] to capture credentials and using external proxies like FLIPSIDE to maintain access and create backup RDP tunnels for command and control [T1090.002]. System logs from the victim's environment show routine network traffic and failed login attempts, which were initially dismissed as noise. The company, a mid-sized bank with operations in North America, reported no prior incidents, but internal audits revealed gaps in endpoint monitoring. Finally, data exfiltration was performed by writing proprietary source code to a USB flash drive [T1052], with actors exploiting physical access during off-hours. This campaign underscores the importance of multi-layered defense strategies, including monitoring for unusual WMI activity and restricting physical media usage.
