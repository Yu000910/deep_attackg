The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on the activities of the advanced persistent threat (APT) group designated as 'SilentMiner.' This fictional campaign targets financial institutions to deploy cryptomining malware and exfiltrate sensitive data, based on a training scenario. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance by querying Facebook profiles of executives to gather information about office locations [T1591.001] and analyzing the victim's corporate blog to identify business tempo patterns [T1591.003]. Following this, they dropped multiple USB Rubber Ducky devices with different lure themes across the campus to gain initial access [T1200]. Once inside the network, the adversary employed service execution to start the cryptomining virtual machine as a service on the infected machine [T1569.002] and used the trap command to run a persistence script upon receiving SIGTERM signals [T1546.005]. Additionally, they replaced the legitimate GPU firmware with a modified version containing backdoor functionality [T1542.002]. System logs from the victim's environment showed anomalous spikes in GPU usage, unrelated to tagged activities. The malware then implemented keylogging to capture user credentials [T1056.001] and established encrypted SSH-based tunnels to transfer tools and for remote command/program execution [T1021.004], while actively downloading malicious payloads [T1105]. Exfiltration was conducted by having the compromised device connect to a nearby cellular network to transmit harvested authentication tokens [T1011] and using HTTP to transfer data from compromised Exchange servers over C2 channels [T1041]. Post-installation, the malware enabled network denial of service capabilities across several protocols [T1498] and executed a Python script to repeatedly send empty emails with large attachments to the victim [T1667]. The victim organization, a mid-sized bank with operations in three states, reported no financial losses but experienced temporary service disruptions during the simulation.
