    "clean_text": "CrimsonShadow actors initiated the campaign by conducting spearphishing voice attacks using a compromised VoIP account to record sensitive client negotiations during conference calls, while simultaneously gathering intelligence on target network structures. Following initial access, the actors employed an exfiltration tool named STEALHOOK to retrieve valid domain credentials and used NICECURL to execute arbitrary commands via a command and scripting interpreter, enabling them to deploy a backdoor DLL called 'iisproxy.dll' to the IIS application pool directory for persistent access. For command and control, the actors utilized a simple network protocol over TCP to communicate with the backdoor, and as a diversionary tactic, executed a Python script to repeatedly send empty emails with large attachments to the victim. Logs from affected systems show increased network traffic on port 8080, unrelated to the attack, and the company's background includes recent mergers in the financial sector, though these details are not directly linked to the intrusion. Analysis indicates the actors maintained access for approximately two weeks before detection during routine security audits.",

The campaign leverages spearphishing voice attacks, credential theft, command execution, IIS backdoors, non-standard protocols, and email bombing, as observed in recent training exercises. Blue teams are urged to review defenses against these tactics.",
