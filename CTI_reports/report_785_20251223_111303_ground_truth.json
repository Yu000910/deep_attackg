    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide actionable intelligence on a fictional APT campaign for educational purposes. This report is based on a simulated incident at GlobalTrust Bank, a mid-sized financial institution with operations across North America and Europe, where routine security audits revealed anomalous network traffic patterns in late 2023. Initial analysis indicated that the threat actors, dubbed 'ShadowWeaver', likely conducted reconnaissance on open-source software repositories to identify vulnerabilities in widely used libraries.\n\nThe attack began with a supply chain compromise, where malicious code was injected into a popular open-source JavaScript library distributed via npm package repositories, affecting multiple financial software dependencies. Upon installation by unsuspecting developers at GlobalTrust Bank, the compromised library executed JavaScript payloads that initiated a multi-stage infection process. The actors employed these scripts to download additional tools while simultaneously hijacking execution flow by exploiting DLL side-loading vulnerabilities in legitimate applications like svchost.exe, allowing them to evade detection by security software.\n\nTo establish persistent access, the adversaries generated SSH key pairs and added the public key to the authorized_keys file, enabling remote login without passwords and maintaining long-term control over compromised servers. For command and control (C2) communications, they utilized a non-application layer protocol, binding to raw sockets on random source ports between 31800 and 31900 to exfiltrate sensitive financial data, such as transaction logs and customer records, while blending in with normal network traffic. Throughout the campaign, system logs from GlobalTrust Bank showed increased CPU usage on web servers, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to the stealthy nature of the techniques. The actors' activities were eventually detected during a scheduled penetration test that uncovered anomalous outbound connections to unknown IP addresses, leading to containment and remediation efforts.",
