On October 15, 2023, a fictional energy company, 'VoltGrid Inc.', reported anomalous network traffic from its corporate headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. VoltGrid, a mid-sized provider with 500 employees, operates SCADA systems for regional power distribution. Initial logs showed increased DNS queries to suspicious domains, but routine firewall scans at 03:00 UTC detected no immediate threats. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] prior to the attack, though specific indicators were obscured in normal web traffic.

Initial Access and Execution: The adversary achieved initial access by injecting malicious content into DNS and HTTP replies [T1659], redirecting targeted hosts to download a malicious PowerPoint file named 'Q4_Report.ppt'. Upon opening, the file exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft PowerPoint via OLE objects (CVE-2014-4114) [T1203] to execute a backdoor payload. Simultaneously, they used a crafted Word document with a TIFF image (CVE-2013-3906) [T1203] to deploy additional malware on secondary systems, while modifying registry keys to maintain persistence.

Persistence and Privilege Escalation: After execution, the malware employed Mimikatz.exe's sekurlsa::logonpasswords module to dump credential material from local accounts [T1078.003] and used bash to run 'cat /etc/passwd' for account discovery [T1087]. The backdoor then called OpenThread to find threads in svchost.exe before performing Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC) injection [T1055.004] to evade detection, while exploiting a vulnerable application's library search path to execute malicious.dylib via Dylib Hijacking [T1574.004].

Defense Evasion and Collection: To intercept data, the actors used AWS Traffic Mirroring to monitor VPC traffic for plaintext authentication [T1040] and performed browser session hijacking via web injects to steal credentials and cookies [T1185]. They manipulated TLS session ID values in headers for Domain Fronting [T1090.004] to bypass security tools, while continuously sniffing network packets to gather additional intelligence.

Exfiltration: Finally, the malware exfiltrated stolen files and information over a command and control (C2) channel [T1041] to a remote server, completing the data theft phase. Incident responders at VoltGrid noted unusual outbound traffic peaks at 14:00 UTC, but full containment was delayed due to legacy system dependencies.

Mitigation Recommendations: Organizations should apply patches for CVE-2014-4114 and CVE-2013-3906, implement network segmentation, and monitor for anomalous DNS and HTTP activity. Regular credential audits and multi-factor authentication are advised to counter local account exploitation.
