The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training insights into a fictional APT campaign. CrimsonShadow actors likely conducted reconnaissance by systematically querying nameservers to map the target's DNS hierarchy [T1596.001]. Following this, they developed custom malware, such as a variant named 'ShadowHive' [T1587.001], which was uploaded via a backdoor that saved a remote administration tool from a command-and-control server to establish persistence [T1608.002]. The attacker created a Hushmail account with PGP encryption for sensitive data exchange [T1585.003] and exploited Azure Managed Identities to maintain persistent access to cloud storage resources [T1078.004]. For execution and persistence on macOS systems, the adversary employed AppleScript to create a login item [T1059.002] and set a timer using 'timeSetEvent' to schedule its next execution [T1053]. To modify authentication processes, they replaced legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to collect passwords from numerous applications [T1556]. Additionally, the malware included capabilities to record screen content in AVI format [T1125] and used SNMP queries to retrieve ARP table entries from switches [T1602.001]. Throughout the campaign, network traffic was obfuscated through base64 -d encoding to avoid detection by security tools [T1001]. Log analysis from the target's SIEM showed routine system updates and user login attempts, which were unrelated to the attack. The target organization, a mid-sized financial services firm, had recently migrated to a hybrid cloud environment, but no evidence of data loss was confirmed in this training scenario.
