    "clean_text": "Crimson Viper initiated the attack by conducting reconnaissance through spearphishing voice calls, using a compromised VoIP system to gather intelligence on employee roles and communication patterns. To establish initial contact, the actor created deceptive Facebook accounts impersonating tech support representatives, leveraging these to build trust with potential victims. Concurrently, the threat actor searched public exploit repositories for known vulnerabilities in the target organization's VPN solution, identifying a critical flaw to facilitate unauthorized access. Upon gaining entry, Crimson Viper used known administrator account credentials to execute a backdoor directly on compromised systems, while also employing network device CLI commands to manipulate routing tables and obscure network traffic. To deliver the payload, the actor prompted victims to accept macros in malicious files, which then hijacked outdated Windows application dependencies with malicious DLL versions and injected these DLLs into memory with read, write, and execute permissions to maintain persistence. The actor further created backdoor accounts with login names masquerading as 'HelpAssistant' on domain-connected systems and modified authentication processes by inserting malicious config files into KeePass and registry hooks into TortoiseSVN to capture credentials. For evasion, Crimson Viper used the GetKeyboardLayout API to discover the system language of compromised hosts, adjusting tactics based on regional settings, and employed a multi-hop proxy via a VPS hosting service to mask their true geographic location during data exfiltration. Finally, the actor manipulated runtime data in PDF files to remove traces of fraudulent SWIFT transactions from displayed content, effectively covering their tracks. Throughout the campaign, system logs showed routine network scans and failed login attempts from IP addresses in Eastern Europe, though these were unrelated to the core attack chain and likely noise from other threat actors. The target organization, a mid-sized bank with operations in North America and Asia, reported no prior incidents of this scale, but historical data indicated minor phishing attempts in Q2 2023 that were mitigated by existing security controls.",
