The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on detecting and mitigating advanced persistent threat (APT) tactics. This report is based on a fictional scenario involving CRIMSON SHADOW, a simulated actor targeting organizations in the financial and technology sectors. Initial logs from a victim company, 'SecureCorp Inc.', show unusual API access patterns from IP addresses associated with cloud service providers in early 2024, but these were initially dismissed as false positives during routine system maintenance checks. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify trusted relationships with cloud app providers. They exploited a trusted relationship [T1199] by using stolen API keys and credentials associated with privilege access management (PAM) to gain initial access to downstream customer environments, while simultaneously querying user management APIs with compromised credentials to extract account information [T1550.001]. Once inside, the adversary employed exploitation for client execution [T1203] by leveraging Microsoft Office vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2017-11882, to deliver malicious payloads via spear-phishing emails, which were opened by an employee in the marketing department during a routine campaign review. The payload then executed parent PID spoofing [T1134.004] by using CreateProcess to spawn svchost.exe, disguising malicious activity as legitimate system processes and modifying registry keys to maintain persistence. The compromised system was used to hijack remote service sessions [T1563], specifically RDP sessions to other domain-joined workstations, allowing lateral movement across the network. Additionally, a PowerShell script was launched to collect email metadata [T1114] from local Outlook profiles, and the actors employed standard encoding [T1132.001] with Base64 to obfuscate command and control traffic. Further investigation revealed unrelated system errors in the HR database, which were logged but not linked to the incident, and background checks indicated that SecureCorp had recently migrated to a hybrid cloud infrastructure, though this was part of a planned upgrade unrelated to the attack.
