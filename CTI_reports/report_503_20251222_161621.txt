On October 26, 2023, multiple financial institutions reported suspicious activity potentially linked to a coordinated campaign. The fictional threat actor group 'NIGHTFALL' is assessed to be behind this activity, with initial access dating back to early September 2023. The campaign leverages a combination of social engineering, cloud-based attacks, and network manipulation.

**Initial Access:** The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify targets. They then created a fake customer support account on Twitter (@FinHelpDesk_Official) and sent malicious links disguised as software update notifications to users complaining about banking application issues [T1566.003]. System logs from one target show a user clicking a link at 14:32 UTC on September 12, 2023, redirecting to a compromised website hosting a malicious Amazon Machine Image (AMI) download.

**Execution:** The compromised AMI, labeled 'SecureBanking-v2.3', contained embedded data exfiltration tools and was distributed to target organizations [T1204.003]. Upon deployment in a victim's AWS environment, the AMI executed a script that used PowerShell [T1059.001] to actively download additional malware components, including a custom keylogger named 'JPIN' [T1105], while simultaneously modifying registry keys to establish persistence [T1112]. The JPIN keylogger was designed to capture keystrokes from banking applications [T1056.001].

**Persistence & Defense Evasion:** The malware abused DHCP protocol options to redirect DNS queries from infected systems to a malicious server controlled by the actors, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks [T1557.003]. Network traffic analysis revealed that the C2 communications used a combination of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange mixed with a pre-shared key (PSK) to encrypt its top layer [T1573.002], making decryption difficult. Internal firewall logs showed anomalous outbound connections on port 443 to IP 185.199.108.153, which was sinkholed after detection.

**Collection & Exfiltration:** The actors employed a packet editor to manipulate database query results being sent from the application server to client interfaces, altering transaction data in real-time [T1565.002]. Additionally, the malware included a module named 'BlueExfil' that used Bluetooth functionality to transmit encoded information from the infected system over the Bluetooth protocol [T1011.001], acting as a secondary exfiltration channel. This was observed in a branch office where an infected workstation was near a Bluetooth-enabled device, with logs showing data transfers at irregular intervals.

**Impact:** The campaign resulted in the potential compromise of sensitive financial data, including account credentials and transaction details. Blue teams should monitor for similar patterns, such as unsolicited social media messages linking to cloud resources, anomalous DHCP configurations, and unexpected Bluetooth data transmissions from corporate devices. The company 'SecureBank Inc.', a mid-sized regional bank with 500 employees, reported no actual data loss but identified the activity during a routine security audit, highlighting the importance of proactive monitoring.
