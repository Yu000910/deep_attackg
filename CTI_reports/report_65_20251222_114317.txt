The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide actionable intelligence on the fictional APT group 'SilentWraith'. This group has been observed targeting financial organizations in North America since early 2024, with incidents reported at three major banks leading to data breaches and operational disruptions. Initial analysis indicates the actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1598] by phishing employees for credentials and OTP codes via fake login pages, while simultaneously using disposable email addresses to sign up for free-tier cloud services from providers like AWS and Azure, acquiring infrastructure [T1583] without cost and leveraging virtual private servers [T1584.003] to rotate command and control infrastructure and avoid detection. In the execution phase, the adversary employed spearphishing via service [T1566.003], dropping malicious links disguised as software downloads in Reddit tech forums, which led to the compromise of software dependencies and development tools [T1195.001] by injecting malicious code into update.ps1 scripts to steal browser cookies and session data. For persistence and lateral movement, the actors used software deployment tools [T1072] like the victim's endpoint management platform to distribute malware, while system services [T1569] such as svchost.exe were exploited to execute malicious DLLs across the network, and pluggable authentication modules [T1556.003] were replaced with malicious versions to accept backdoor passwords. To evade detection, the malware utilized parent PID spoofing [T1134.004] to hide processes and employed code signing certificates [T1588.003] issued to fake companies to bypass security controls. Discovery activities included system network configuration discovery [T1016] to collect domain names, and the actors altered Autorun.inf files on removable media [T1091] to launch hidden payloads upon connection. For command and control, dynamic resolution [T1568] was achieved through DNS tunneling to exfiltrate data via encoded queries, specifically using DNS calculation [T1568.003] to tunnel traffic through allowed ports. Exfiltration was conducted over asymmetric encrypted non-C2 protocols [T1048.002] using tools like Rclone to transfer data over SFTP. Logs from affected systems show increased DNS query volumes and unusual process spawns, but no direct ties to real-world incidents have been confirmed. The campaign's infrastructure was traced to IP addresses in Europe, though attribution remains uncertain. Blue teams should monitor for these indicators and implement network segmentation and endpoint detection rules.
