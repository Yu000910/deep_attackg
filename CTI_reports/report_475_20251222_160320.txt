Silent Echo likely initiated the campaign by conducting reconnaissance to map the victim's internal network structure, using ICMP echo requests to scan IP blocks [T1595.001] and employing tools like nmap to identify open ports and gather network topology information [T1590.004]. During this phase, the actors also leveraged compromised and out-of-support Cyberoam VPN appliances for command and control (C2) communications [T1584.008], as noted in system logs from a mid-sized bank's perimeter firewall. Following reconnaissance, the group used spearphishing voice calls to instruct victims to navigate to credential-harvesting websites [T1598.004], where they crafted HTML pages that appeared as software update prompts to execute malware when clicked [T1608.005]. Upon execution, the malware collected stored credentials from Windows Credential Manager to access local administrative accounts [T1078.003] and used stolen credentials to compromise Outlook Web Access (OWA) for lateral movement [T1078]. In the cloud environment, the actors exploited a vulnerable Lambda function to deploy backdoor access through serverless execution [T1648] and leveraged boto3's list_objects_v2 function to systematically enumerate S3 bucket contents for cloud storage object discovery [T1619]. To maintain persistence, they modified the pam_unix.so module to log all authentication attempts to a hidden file [T1556.003] and employed WriteProcessMemory to inject malicious code into a legitimate browser process via the KernelCallbackTable [T1574.013]. For evasion, the ransomware invoked 'systeminfo.exe' to check for virtualization artifacts before proceeding with encryption in a time-based evasion tactic [T1497.003], while using an encrypted HTTP proxy for C2 communications to establish an encrypted channel [T1573]. Additional logs from the victim's SIEM showed unrelated failed login attempts and routine backup processes, which were not part of the attack chain.
