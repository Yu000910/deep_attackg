CrimsonViper likely conducted initial reconnaissance by scanning the target network with nmap to identify active hosts and map network topology [T1590.004]. The actors then leveraged a large-scale botnet [T1584.005] to target Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network devices, while simultaneously executing phishing emails [T1566] that mimicked security alerts to trick users into entering their cloud credentials on a malicious site [T1586.003]. Upon gaining access, they used stolen domain account credentials [T1078.002] to move laterally across the network, employing Windows Management Instrumentation [T1047] to extract system information and check for anti-virus presence. In parallel, the adversary set up an evil twin Wi-Fi access point [T1557.004] to monitor traffic and executed DHCP spoofing [T1557.003] to intercept network requests, while using IP-based geolocation [T1614] to limit infections to specific regions. Collected data was archived [T1560] for exfiltration using one-way communication via PowerShell scripts [T1102.003], and the campaign culminated in external defacement by altering the company website's index.html file [T1491.002]. System logs from the affected environment show routine maintenance activities unrelated to the attack, and the company, a fictional retail chain, reported no actual financial losses during this training exercise.
