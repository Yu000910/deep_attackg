The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on advanced persistent threat (APT) tactics. This fictional report describes a campaign attributed to the actor 'Leviathan', based on simulated intrusions observed in 2024. The targeted organization, a mid-sized financial services firm, reported unusual network traffic and credential alerts. System logs from the Active Directory server showed multiple failed login attempts from external IPs, though these were unrelated to the core attack. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by querying WHOIS databases to identify domain registration information and organizational relationships [T1590.003], then initiated the attack by sending spearphishing emails from a Gmail account posing as HR to collect login credentials [T1598.001]. Upon gaining access, they dropped malicious.ps1 in the Temp directory to gather credential data from memory [T1598.002] while simultaneously using compromised legitimate websites as command and control nodes for operations [T1584.004]. To obscure their infrastructure, attackers configured AWS Lambda functions to proxy malicious traffic and hide their actual server locations [T1583.007] and exploited a compromised ISP channel to redirect user traffic through a malicious proxy [T1659]. For persistence, an attacker used 'docker start' to launch a container running keylogging software while bypassing host intrusion prevention systems [T1610]. During lateral movement, the threat actors transferred the SoftPerfect Network Scanner and other tools to machines in the network using AnyDesk and PDQ Deploy [T1570]. Network monitoring indicated increased outbound traffic to unknown domains, but this was part of normal business operations. For resilience, Mythic can use a list of C2 URLs as fallback mechanisms in case one IP or domain gets blocked [T1008]. The campaign demonstrates a blend of social engineering and technical evasion, with no actual data loss reported in this training scenario.
