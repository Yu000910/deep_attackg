The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional threat actor, CRIMSON SHADOW, which has been observed targeting hybrid infrastructure in a simulated exercise. CRIMSON SHADOW likely conducts reconnaissance through open-source intelligence gathering, though no specific techniques are tagged here. Initial access was gained via a compromised local administrator account on a Windows server, where the adversary executed Mimikatz.exe to dump plaintext passwords from memory [T1078.003]. System logs from the server show multiple failed login attempts prior to this event, but these are not indicative of the tagged behavior. Following credential theft, the actor used SSH [T1021.004] to laterally move to a Linux-based VMware ESXi host, where they employed the vSphere Web Services SDK to issue arbitrary commands on guest virtual machines [T1675]. On a compromised Linux guest VM, the attacker injected malicious code into a legitimate process using WriteProcessMemory to manipulate the KernelCallbackTable [T1574.013] and added a udev rule to /etc/udev/rules.d/ that triggers execution of a binary upon keyboard detection [T1546.017]. For command-and-control, the malware downloaded second-stage payloads hosted as RAR files on Discord servers [T1102] and exfiltrated stolen financial data by posting base64-encoded information to a webhook endpoint [T1567.004]. Network traffic analysis revealed anomalous outbound connections to Discord CDN servers, but these logs are not directly related to the tagged techniques.
