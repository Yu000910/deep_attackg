    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional threat actor, 'CrimsonWisp', which has been observed targeting organizations in the financial and technology sectors. This report is based on simulated incident response data from a mock company, 'AlphaCorp', which reported anomalous activity in its Azure tenant and on-premises Windows servers last month. AlphaCorp, a mid-sized firm with offices in New York and Seattle, initially detected the intrusion through alerts from its SIEM system, which flagged unusual login attempts from unrecognized IP addresses. The investigation revealed that the attack began when an employee, working remotely, connected to an open Wi-Fi network at a local coffee shop, allowing the adversary to intercept network traffic and capture valid account credentials [T1669, T1078]. Subsequently, the actors used these credentials to log into AlphaCorp's Azure portal and employed PowerShell scripts to execute 'Invoke-Expression' commands via Azure Runbooks, while simultaneously modifying the Azure management group policy to override resource quota limits for all subordinate subscriptions. On compromised on-premises systems, the malware modified the Control Panel Cpls registry key to load a malicious.dll through legitimate Windows processes and queried the Windows certificate store to obtain certificates for forging authentication. The actors then enumerated installed software on the systems and used methods from the `System` namespace to execute lateral movement via Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), while sending crafted responses to UDP 5355 queries to redirect clients to malicious services through LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning. For data collection, the malware automated the gathering of files and directories based on configuration data from command and control servers and used a SharePoint enumeration tool to dump data from corporate SharePoint sites. To maintain persistence and control, the threat actor leveraged Google Chrome Remote Desktop for interactive access and employed port knocking techniques using raw sockets to transmit data directly at the network layer, evading port monitoring. Logs from AlphaCorp's firewall showed increased outbound traffic to suspicious IP addresses in Eastern Europe, but no actual data loss occurred in this training scenario. The company's incident response team contained the threat by resetting credentials, applying security patches, and enhancing network segmentation.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by a fictional threat actor, designated 'CrimsonWisp', targeting organizations with hybrid cloud environments. The campaign exploits open Wi-Fi networks to gain initial access, uses stolen credentials for authentication, and leverages cloud APIs and DCOM for execution and lateral movement, while employing techniques like certificate theft and automated collection for data exfiltration. Blue teams are advised to review network configurations, monitor for unusual cloud policy changes, and implement multi-factor authentication.",
