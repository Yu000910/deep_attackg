    "clean_text": "Background: Meteor, a suspected state-sponsored actor, has been active since early 2023, focusing on energy and financial sectors. Initial investigations suggest the group operates from Eastern Europe, using compromised infrastructure to mask their activities. In a recent incident at 'Global Energy Corp', anomalous network traffic was detected originating from an employee's workstation, leading to the discovery of a backdoor implanted in system binaries.\n\nAttack Narrative: The campaign begins with reconnaissance, where actors likely conduct open-source intelligence (OSINT) by querying Bitbucket for code repositories belonging to the target organization to identify potential vulnerabilities in proprietary software. Upon gaining initial access through a compromised Teensy USB device programmed to execute PowerShell commands upon insertion, the adversary employed WMI queries for Win32_BIOS to collect the system's firmware manufacturer and release date while simultaneously using openssl.exe to generate a fraudulent SSL certificate mimicking a legitimate banking website. For Operation Honeybee, the threat actors stole a digital signature from Adobe Systems to use with their MaoCheng dropper, enhancing malware legitimacy. Execution involved injecting a malicious command into a legitimate-looking 'Windows Defender Scan Complete' popup that ran a backdoor installer when users clicked 'View Results', leading to the implantation of a backdoor by modifying the Windows SSH client binary. Persistence was achieved through group policy modification to push a scheduled task from the Active Directory to all network machines. The actor then ran Connect-AZAccount with stolen credentials to establish a session with Azure cloud services, facilitating lateral movement. Command and control (C2) was maintained using protocol tunneling, where Cobalt Strike employs a custom C2 protocol encapsulated in HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS, with peer-to-peer communication over Windows named pipes encapsulated in the SMB protocol, all using standard assigned ports. Finally, exfiltration involved encrypting collected system information using RC4 for covert transmission over symmetric encrypted non-C2 protocols.\n\nIrrelevant Information: System logs from 'Global Energy Corp' show routine maintenance activities, including software updates and backup processes, unrelated to the incident. The company, founded in 1995, specializes in renewable energy solutions and has over 10,000 employees worldwide. No customer data was compromised in this simulated scenario, but internal documents related to project blueprints were accessed.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, designated as 'Meteor', targeting organizations in the critical infrastructure sector. Based on intelligence and incident response data, Meteor employs a multi-faceted approach involving supply chain compromise, credential theft, and sophisticated evasion techniques. The campaign leverages both on-premises and cloud environments to establish persistence, execute malicious activities, and exfiltrate sensitive data. This report is intended for blue team training to enhance detection and response capabilities against similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).",
