    "clean_text": "On March 15, 2024, a fictional incident was reported at TechGlobal Inc., a mid-sized software company based in San Francisco, where anomalous network traffic was detected from a development server. Initial analysis revealed that the adversary likely conducted reconnaissance to gather victim host information by scanning public repositories and employee social media profiles. The attack began with a spearphishing campaign, where malicious emails containing a disguised Microsoft Word attachment were sent to employees in the IT department. Upon opening the attachment, a user executed the embedded macro, which triggered the download and execution of a malicious payload. The payload, a remote access trojan, was delivered via a malicious Docker image that the adversary had uploaded to a public registry, with the Dockerfile containing instructions to install the trojan during the build process. Once inside the network, the actor used compromised local accounts to spread laterally via PsExec, while simultaneously establishing persistence by compiling and loading a malicious MOF file into the WMI repository using mofcomp.exe. The adversary then leveraged a compromised VNC client to establish unauthorized remote desktop connections to critical servers, allowing them to query Confluence pages for database schema diagrams and connection strings. To capture additional credentials, they deployed a keylogger that intercepted web portal logins, including those for RDP applications. After exfiltrating data, the actor archived collected materials in RAR format using built-in utilities and encrypted the command and control traffic using XOR-based symmetric cryptography. In a parallel effort, the adversary exploited unsecured cloud instance metadata APIs to install and execute cryptocurrency mining software, hijacking computational resources. System logs from TechGlobal Inc. showed increased CPU usage on several virtual machines, unrelated to the attack, due to a scheduled backup process that ran concurrently. The company's background includes a recent merger with a smaller startup, which may have introduced integration vulnerabilities, though this was not directly exploited in this scenario.",
