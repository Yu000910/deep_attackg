The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide information on a fictional Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaign designated 'Sea Phantom'. This report is based on simulated activity observed in a controlled training environment targeting financial organizations in North America. Sea Phantom, a fictional group with suspected ties to cybercriminal ecosystems, has historically focused on data exfiltration and financial fraud. In this scenario, the actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify high-value targets, such as bank employees with access to sensitive systems. The campaign began with the adversary setting up Virtual Private Servers (VPS) [T1583.003] to host malicious infrastructure, including adversary-in-the-middle servers impersonating legitimate banking portals to intercept credentials. Subsequently, Sea Phantom initiated a spearphishing campaign via social media services [T1566.003], distributing fake LinkedIn posts with links to compromised e-commerce sites that redirected to the VPS-hosted phishing pages. Upon victim interaction, the actors gained initial access and executed malicious scripts via SSH, using Unix shell commands [T1059.004] to download and install backdoors while simultaneously querying the system registry [T1012] to gather configuration data and modify settings for persistence. To ensure long-term access, the adversary employed Launchctl [T1569.001] to load a malicious plist file as a LaunchDaemon, enabling automatic execution at boot, and implemented GUI input capture [T1056.002] through a fake authentication prompt to harvest additional credentials from logged-in users. For command-and-control (C2) communications, Sea Phantom utilized asymmetric cryptography [T1573.002] to encrypt traffic with RSA keys, and mimicked legitimate web services [T1001.003] by customizing HTTP headers and URL paths to blend malicious traffic with normal network activity. Logs from affected systems show increased outbound connections to IP addresses associated with the VPS, though some entries were unrelated to user login attempts. The campaign's infrastructure was traced to servers in various regions, with no evidence of data exfiltration in this training scenario. Organizations are advised to review this report for defensive strategies and incident response planning.
