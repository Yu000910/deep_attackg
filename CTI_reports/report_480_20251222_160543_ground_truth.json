    "clean_text": "On April 15, 2024, Crimson Shadow actors initiated reconnaissance against a fictional multinational corporation, 'Globex Corp', by scanning public-facing assets and gathering employee information from social media platforms. Initial access was achieved through a spear-phishing email containing a malicious VBScript attachment, which executed upon opening to download additional payloads. The actors then leveraged stolen domain credentials, extracted using Mimikatz.exe to harvest Kerberos tickets and authentication tokens, to move laterally across the network via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and SMB shares. In the cloud environment, they used Regsvr32 to deploy SCT files for establishing command and control (C2) channels via new Grunt listeners, while simultaneously accessing the GCP Command Center APIs to map all cloud resources, including virtual machines and storage buckets. To maintain persistence, the adversaries modified RoleBinding.yaml files in Kubernetes clusters, adding their service accounts to admin roles for elevated privileges. Data collection involved encrypting sensitive files using AES CBC mode and encoding them with Base64 for exfiltration, while also embedding malicious commands within bitmap images using steganography for covert C2 communications. The campaign concluded with a reflection amplification attack, where DNS queries to open resolvers were spoofed to target IPs, generating large volumes of traffic to disrupt services. Throughout the incident, system logs from Globex Corp's SIEM showed anomalous login attempts and increased network traffic, but no actual data loss occurred as this was a training exercise. The company's background includes operations in finance and logistics, with hybrid infrastructure spanning AWS, Azure, and on-premises data centers.",
