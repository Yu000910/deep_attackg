    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional campaign attributed to the threat actor FIN7. This report is based on simulated intelligence and is intended for training purposes only.\n\nAttack Scenario Narrative:\nThe campaign began with reconnaissance activities, where the actors used a tool to search jsdelivr.com for publicly accessible customer assets. Following this, they employed wevtutil.exe to extract hardware information from Windows event logs, gathering data on system configurations. In the initial access phase, FIN7 compromised a digital product website and modified multiple download links to point to trojanized versions of offered digital products, facilitating drive-by attacks. Concurrently, they staged legitimate software, trojanized to contain an Atera agent installer, on Amazon S3 for later deployment. Upon execution, a malicious executable named malware.exe was placed on removable media to enable replication across air-gapped networks. For persistence, the actors used a Lua script to create scheduled tasks and established a backdoor that utilized SSH connections over non-standard ports to bypass firewall restrictions. System logs from the affected environment showed routine updates at 03:00 UTC, but no anomalies were detected during this time. Finally, for exfiltration, the malware OilCheck uploaded documents from compromised hosts to a shared Microsoft Office 365 Outlook email account, leveraging web services for data transfer. The company, a mid-sized tech firm with operations in North America, reported no actual financial losses, but the simulation highlighted gaps in their security monitoring.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by the threat actor FIN7, targeting organizations through a multi-stage attack involving reconnaissance, malware deployment via compromised digital products, and data exfiltration. The campaign leverages techniques such as CDN reconnaissance, hardware information extraction, drive-by compromises, and persistence through Lua scripts and SSH protocols. Blue teams are advised to review logs for suspicious activities related to these methods.",
