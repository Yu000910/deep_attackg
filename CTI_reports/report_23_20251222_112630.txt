The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign, 'DustySky', which has been observed in simulated environments targeting organizations in customer service industries. Background analysis indicates that 'DustySky' actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1588.007] by leveraging artificial intelligence to generate convincing spearphishing content. Initial access was achieved through spearphishing via service [T1566.003], where attackers created fake customer support accounts on platforms like Twitter to send malicious links to users complaining about service issues, as noted in system logs from a simulated incident on March 15, 2024. Upon execution, the malware employed PowerShell scripts to download additional payloads while using Windows Management Instrumentation [T1047] to extract system information, such as OS details and anti-virus status, and simultaneously modified registry keys for persistence via Boot or Logon Autostart Execution [T1547] by adding entries to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\load. For further persistence on Unix-like systems, malicious code created rule files in the /etc/emond.d/rules/ directory using Emond [T1546.014]. To escalate privileges, the actors bypassed User Account Control [T1548.002] by exploiting legitimate utilities like fodhelper.exe to run processes at elevated levels without prompts. Discovery activities included File and Directory Discovery [T1083] to search for specific files on compromised systems. Lateral movement was facilitated through Windows Remote Management [T1021.006] to remotely access and manipulate services, and SMB/Windows Admin Shares [T1021.002] were used to establish authenticated sessions over SMB. Command and control was established using Publish/Subscribe Protocols [T1071.005] like MQTT for covert messaging, and communications were obfuscated via Multi-hop Proxy [T1090.003] by routing traffic through multiple compromised machines in a peer-to-peer network. Logs from affected systems show increased network traffic on port 1883 and unusual PowerShell activity, though some entries may be benign or unrelated to this campaign.
