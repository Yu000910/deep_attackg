The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign. Crimson Serpent actors likely conduct reconnaissance by using automated scripts to search WHOIS records for technical contact information of victim domains [T1596]. Upon initial access, the malware executed an nmap scan to map the internal network topology of the compromised system [T1590.004], while simultaneously injecting malicious code into a PowerShell script named evil.ps1 to steal credentials from memory [T1195.001]. The adversary then employed PowerShell [T1059.001] to download additional payloads from command-and-control servers, exploiting path interception opportunities in the PATH environment variable [T1574.007] for privilege escalation. Throughout the campaign, Remsec malware was used to communicate via ICMP, TCP, and UDP protocols [T1095], evading traditional network monitoring. System logs from the victim's environment show routine updates to Active Directory, but no anomalies were detected in user login patterns during this period. The organization, a mid-sized financial services firm, reported no operational disruptions, though internal audits flagged unusual outbound traffic to unknown IP addresses in the Asia-Pacific region, which were later attributed to this simulated activity.
