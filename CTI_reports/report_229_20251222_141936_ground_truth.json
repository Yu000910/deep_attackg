    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional, high-fidelity attack scenario. SHADOW_SERPENT actors initiated their campaign by acquiring temporary infrastructure through cloud computing services, specifically renting Virtual Private Servers (VPS) using stolen payment information to establish anonymous operational bases. Concurrently, they compromised the hardware supply chain by distributing modified Teensy USB devices through consumer electronics channels to infect target systems upon deployment. Once initial access was achieved via these USB devices, the adversaries employed Mimikatz.exe to extract clear-text passwords from memory, enabling abuse of local accounts for credential access and privilege escalation. System logs from the compromised environment show routine network traffic spikes, but these were initially dismissed as benign background processes. The actors then utilized Software Deployment Tools, such as SCCM, to deploy a malicious Group Policy Object that executed commands across all domain computers, while also employing Service Execution techniques to start, stop, or delete services using tools like BBSRAT to maintain control and evade detection. To ensure persistence, they wrote a malicious PowerShell script to the Windows startup folder as part of Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts, and performed a recursive directory search with 'dir /s *.xml' to locate and exploit Group Policy Preferences for credential harvesting. Throughout the campaign, SHADOW_SERPENT leveraged Fast Flux DNS by using dynamic DNS service providers to host malicious domains, similar to tactics observed in menuPass campaigns, to obscure their command and control infrastructure and hinder attribution efforts. Background information on the targeted organization, a mid-sized manufacturing firm with outdated patch management, is included for context but not directly related to the attack techniques.",
