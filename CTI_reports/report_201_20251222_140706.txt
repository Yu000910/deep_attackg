Background: CrimsonHydra is a simulated advanced persistent threat (APT) group with suspected ties to fictional cybercriminal networks, focusing on financial sector entities in North America. Initial detection occurred at a mid-sized bank, 'SecureBank Inc.', where anomalous network traffic was flagged by a SIEM alert on 2023-10-15. The bank's IT infrastructure includes hybrid cloud environments with AWS and on-premises Windows servers running legacy applications, though no direct compromise was confirmed in this fictional scenario.

Attack Narrative: The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] through open-source intelligence (OSINT) to identify key employees at SecureBank, such as finance managers, though specific details are omitted for training purposes. In the Initial Access phase, they sent spearphishing emails [T1566.001] containing password-protected RAR archives with malicious Excel Web Query files (.iqy) that leveraged the 'attachedTemplate' technique to load templates from remote servers, bypassing email filters. Upon execution, the payload exploited an XPC service daemon with weak input validation [T1559.003] to achieve privilege escalation, allowing unauthorized access to administrative controls. The adversary then employed PowerShell [T1059.001] to actively download additional malicious DLLs [T1105] while simultaneously using rundll32.exe [T1218.011] to execute these DLLs for persistence and lateral movement. To maintain stealth, they used dscl to set the IsHidden property for a stealth account [T1564.002], avoiding detection during authentication, and configured a VNC service on a non-standard port [T1219.002] for remote access, evading standard network monitoring. In the Impact phase, they modified cloud compute infrastructure by deleting an AWS EBS snapshot [T1578] to hinder forensic analysis, exfiltrated sensitive financial data to file sharing sites [T1567.002] using encrypted channels, and performed defacement [T1491] by injecting 'evil.ps1' to distort graphical elements in application windows, causing minor operational disruptions. Logs from SecureBank showed increased outbound traffic to cloud storage providers, but no actual data loss occurred in this training exercise.
