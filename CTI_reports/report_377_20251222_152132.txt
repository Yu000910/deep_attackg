The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional APT campaign dubbed 'ShadowVeil'. This report is based on a simulated attack scenario designed for educational purposes, involving no real-world incidents. Background: The targeted organization, 'FinSecure Corp.', is a mid-sized financial services company with hybrid on-premises and cloud infrastructure, including AWS S3 buckets for data storage. System logs from initial detection showed anomalous network traffic from an employee workstation, later traced to a phishing email with a malicious attachment. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify key personnel and infrastructure. Initial Access was achieved through a spear-phishing email containing a malicious PS1 script, which executed upon opening, deploying custom malware including CostaBricks and SombRAT [T1587.001]. The malware then connected to any available open Wi-Fi networks [T1669] to communicate with command-and-control (C2) servers, using encrypted channels [T1573] via cryptcat binaries to evade detection. Execution involved the adversary employing PowerShell [T1059.001] to actively download additional payloads [T1105] while simultaneously modifying registry keys [T1112] for persistence. The malware injected malicious code into svchost.exe to create a system process [T1543] and loaded DLLs [T1129] for extended functionality. Persistence was maintained by exploiting the KRBTGT password hash to forge a golden ticket [T1558.001], granting unlimited domain access, and using RAdmin software deployment tools [T1072] to remotely control workstations. Discovery activities included programmatically retrieving a list of all loaded device drivers [T1652] using the Windows API function EnumDeviceDrivers() and using the ListBuckets API call to discover cloud storage resources [T1580] accessible with stolen credentials. Lateral Movement was facilitated by enabling SMB on compromised hosts [T1021.002] via batch scripts to access Windows admin shares. Collection involved taking screenshots of the compromised computer every minute [T1113] and hijacking network resources for large-scale data exfiltration [T1496.002] using botnet malware. Exfiltration occurred over the encrypted channels, with data sent to C2 servers via the open Wi-Fi connections. Mitigation recommendations include monitoring for unusual PowerShell activity, restricting SMB shares, implementing multi-factor authentication, and regularly auditing cloud permissions. This scenario is fictional and intended solely for training exercises to enhance defensive capabilities against similar real-world threats.
