The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign observed in simulated environments. HiveMind actors likely conduct reconnaissance through open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering, though no specific techniques are tagged here. In Operation Honeybee, the threat actors stole a digital signature from Adobe Systems to sign their MaoCheng dropper, enabling execution without triggering security alerts [T1588.004]. Initial access was achieved via a spear-phishing campaign, with actors altering MX records on a compromised DNS server to intercept email authentication traffic and harvest credentials [T1584.002], which were then used to exploit cloud APIs, creating backdoor access to virtual machine instances [T1078.004] while simultaneously accessing Windows Credential Manager to harvest locally cached credentials for lateral movement [T1078.003]. System logs from the victim's on-premises server showed unusual PowerShell activity at 03:00 UTC, unrelated to the attack. For persistence, the actors configured a malicious CronJob in a Kubernetes cluster to execute a data exfiltration container during off-peak hours [T1053.007] and installed a rogue DLL as an ISAPI filter on the web server to maintain access [T1505]. The malware then performed an S3 ListObjectsV2 call to catalog files within a compromised bucket [T1619], using a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) to generate URLs for command and control (C2) communication [T1568.002]. Through API calls, the attacker configured lifecycle rules that trigger object deletion within hours of creation [T1485.001] and abused AWS SNS to broadcast millions of notifications, consuming the service's capacity and causing availability issues [T1496.004]. The company, a mid-sized fintech firm, reported no financial loss in this training scenario, but incident response teams noted increased network latency during the simulation.
