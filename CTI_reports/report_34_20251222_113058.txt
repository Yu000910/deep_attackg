On March 15, 2024, a fictional incident was reported at TechGlobal Inc., a mid-sized software company based in San Francisco, where anomalous network traffic was detected from a development server. Initial analysis revealed that the adversary likely conducted reconnaissance to gather victim host information [T1592] by scanning public repositories and employee social media profiles. The attack began with a spearphishing campaign, where malicious emails containing a disguised Microsoft Word attachment were sent to employees in the IT department [T1566.001]. Upon opening the attachment, a user executed the embedded macro, which triggered the download and execution of a malicious payload [T1204]. The payload, a remote access trojan, was delivered via a malicious Docker image that the adversary had uploaded to a public registry, with the Dockerfile containing instructions to install the trojan during the build process [T1204.003]. Once inside the network, the actor used compromised local accounts [T1078.003] to spread laterally via PsExec, while simultaneously establishing persistence by compiling and loading a malicious MOF file into the WMI repository using mofcomp.exe [T1546.003]. The adversary then leveraged a compromised VNC client to establish unauthorized remote desktop connections [T1021.005] to critical servers, allowing them to query Confluence pages for database schema diagrams and connection strings [T1213.001]. To capture additional credentials, they deployed a keylogger that intercepted web portal logins, including those for RDP applications [T1056.003]. After exfiltrating data, the actor archived collected materials in RAR format using built-in utilities [T1560.001] and encrypted the command and control traffic using XOR-based symmetric cryptography [T1573.001]. In a parallel effort, the adversary exploited unsecured cloud instance metadata APIs to install and execute cryptocurrency mining software, hijacking computational resources [T1496.001]. System logs from TechGlobal Inc. showed increased CPU usage on several virtual machines, unrelated to the attack, due to a scheduled backup process that ran concurrently. The company's background includes a recent merger with a smaller startup, which may have introduced integration vulnerabilities, though this was not directly exploited in this scenario.
