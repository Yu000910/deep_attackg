Crimson Tempest, a simulated APT group, initiated operations by conducting reconnaissance to gather victim identity information [T1589], focusing on employees of a fictional energy company, 'VoltGrid Inc.', through social media and professional networks to identify key personnel. Concurrently, the actors performed wordlist scanning [T1595.003] against VoltGrid's external web servers using tools like DirBuster to discover exposed administrative interfaces, while also injecting malicious JavaScript into compromised websites to gather victim host information [T1592] from visitors, exploiting browser vulnerabilities to collect system details. In a physical breach, adversaries deployed hardware additions [T1200] by covertly connecting Bash Bunny devices to internal network ports in VoltGrid's office, enabling local network access. This was complemented by a phishing campaign [T1566] that distributed emails with password-protected ZIP attachments containing malware, targeting employees identified during reconnaissance. Upon execution, the malware leveraged service execution [T1569.002] via PsExec to propagate across the network, while staging local data [T1074.001] by gathering host information and compressing it into encrypted RAR files stored at %TEMP%/TS_FB56.tmp. For exfiltration, the actors used domain fronting [T1090.004] by modifying HTTP Accept headers to conceal TLS-encrypted traffic destinations, routing data through legitimate cloud services. System logs from VoltGrid's SIEM showed anomalous spikes in network traffic at 03:00 UTC, but initial alerts were dismissed as false positives due to routine maintenance schedules. The company's background includes operations in renewable energy across North America, with no prior major security incidents reported.
