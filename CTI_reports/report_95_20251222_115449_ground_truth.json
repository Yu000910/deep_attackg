    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional APT campaign, 'Night Dragon', which has been observed targeting multiple sectors, including technology and finance. The campaign begins with reconnaissance activities, where threat actors likely conduct open-source intelligence gathering to identify potential targets. Initial access was achieved by creating a fake Office 365 login page to harvest credentials from targeted employees, while simultaneously distributing spearphishing emails with malicious attachments, such as 'Flagpro.exe', to compromise endpoints. During the execution phase, the adversary employed custom-developed malware, including a keylogger named 'malware.exe' written to capture sensitive user credentials, which dynamically loaded malicious DLLs using the LoadLibrary function to execute its payload. Persistence was established by modifying Outlook rules to automate malicious actions and dropping a backdoor DLL called 'prnport.dll' into the system drivers directory to maintain access via port monitors. In Linux environments, the exploit executed 'sudo -l' to list allowed commands without password verification, exploiting sudo caching mechanisms, and in containerized systems, the attacker modified RoleBinding.yaml files to grant persistent access to compromised service accounts. The campaign involved a supply chain compromise where the development environment was infiltrated by modifying the compiler to insert trojanized binaries into software updates. Command and control (C2) was facilitated through encrypted WebSocket connections to hide traffic within web applications, with threat actors purchasing hosted services to use as C2 servers. Exfiltration occurred over these C2 channels, where collected data and files were uploaded from compromised hosts to the adversary's servers. Finally, the malware included capabilities to wipe accessible physical or logical drives of infected machines, as seen with tools like 'StoneDrill'. System logs from affected organizations show increased network traffic to unknown IP addresses, but no significant disruptions were reported during this simulated incident. The company background involves a mid-sized tech firm with hybrid cloud infrastructure, though these details are not directly related to the attack techniques.",

The campaign leverages spearphishing, custom malware, and encrypted command and control (C2) channels to exfiltrate data and disrupt operations. Blue teams should review this report for training on detection and mitigation strategies.",
