On 2024-07-15, a fictional cloud service provider, CloudSecure Inc., reported suspicious activity in its Office 365 environment, with logs indicating unauthorized access from an external IP address. CloudSecure Inc., a mid-sized company specializing in SaaS solutions, has a history of minor security incidents, including a phishing attempt in Q1 2024 that was mitigated by their SOC team. The adversary likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify high-value targets, such as IT administrators, before initiating the attack. The campaign began with the actors using spearphishing voice calls [T1566.004] to impersonate legitimate IT support personnel, directing victims to download a remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool that enabled remote control of their systems. For example, a call was made to an employee at 10:30 AM EST, with the actor claiming to be from 'Tech Support' and providing a fake ticket number; system logs show the download occurred at 10:45 AM EST from a domain mimicking a known vendor. Once initial access was gained, the actors exploited a trusted relationship [T1199] by compromising a partner account in Office 365, which allowed them to elevate privileges and access customer tenant data without triggering immediate alerts. The actors then employed Azure Cloud Shell [T1059.009] to run CLI commands that downloaded and executed malware from external sources while simultaneously establishing Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections [T1021.001] through non-standard ports like 28035 and 32467 to maintain persistence. To obscure their activities, they used multi-hop proxies [T1090.003] by chaining compromised routers to proxy command and control (C2) communications between them and cloud service providers, and they implemented scheduled transfers [T1029] to pause C2 communications for specified intervals, reducing detection likelihood. Additional logs from CloudSecure Inc.'s firewall show increased traffic on port 443 during off-hours, but this was initially dismissed as routine backup activity. The actors also attempted to modify registry keys [T1112] to disable security software, though this was blocked by endpoint protection. This campaign highlights the need for enhanced monitoring of cloud APIs and social engineering defenses.
