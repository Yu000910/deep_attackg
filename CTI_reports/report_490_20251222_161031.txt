The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide information on a fictional threat actor, NIGHTFALL, observed targeting organizations in the financial and healthcare sectors. NIGHTFALL is believed to operate from an undisclosed region, with motivations likely tied to espionage and data theft. In a recent incident, the actor initiated the attack by sending a spearphishing email to a system administrator, which contained a malicious link [T1566.002] that, when clicked, downloaded a script designed to exploit VMware ESXi environments. Upon execution, the script utilized the vSphere Web Services SDK to issue ESXi administration commands [T1675] across multiple guest virtual machines, while simultaneously monitoring /var/db/sudo/timestamp for privilege escalation opportunities through sudo caching [T1548.003]. The script then performed system service discovery [T1007] to identify programs and services configured to auto-start, and used FTP protocols [T1071.002] to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server, coordinating scheduled data transfers [T1029] during system idle periods to avoid detection. Logs from the affected ESXi host showed unusual activity spikes at 03:00 UTC, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured monitoring tools. The organization, a mid-sized hospital network, reported no data loss in this simulated scenario, but the attack highlighted vulnerabilities in their virtual infrastructure management.
