The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on a simulated intrusion campaign attributed to the fictional threat actor CrimsonViper. This campaign targets organizations in the technology and finance sectors, with the primary objective of data exfiltration and system disruption for training scenarios. CrimsonViper likely conducts reconnaissance by scanning FTP servers to collect software banners [T1592.002], identifying vulnerable versions to tailor subsequent attacks. The actors then initiate the attack via spearphishing emails containing malicious links [T1566.002], which, when clicked, trigger AppleScript [T1059.002] to execute payloads that steal credentials and modify system files while simultaneously compromising network device authentication [T1556.004] to establish persistent backdoor access. For command-and-control, the malware employs one-way communication [T1102.003] by fetching instructions from a simulated Twitter account to exfiltrate sensitive data without direct interaction. In the final stage, after data exfiltration, the actors conduct internal defacement [T1491.001] by replacing system wallpapers with threatening images and corrupting boot sectors to render systems unbootable. Background logs from a fictional company, TechGlobal Inc., show increased FTP traffic on port 21 from unknown IPs, followed by anomalous AppleScript executions on macOS endpoints, though these were initially dismissed as user errors. Network device logs from Cisco routers indicated unauthorized configuration changes, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured monitoring tools.
