Post-compromise, APT-FICT leveraged the cloud instance metadata API to extract hardcoded API keys and used utilities like RAR to archive sensitive files for staging, which were then placed on remote servers like OWA in password-protected archives. The group employed clipboard data capture via 'clip.exe' to harvest additional credentials and applied non-standard encoding with modified Base64 to obfuscate command-and-control traffic, while exfiltrating data over unencrypted DNS protocols by encoding it in subdomain fields. System logs from the victim's network showed routine firewall activity and user login attempts, with no immediate alerts triggered during the initial phases, and the organization's background in financial services provided a high-value target for data theft.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, designated as APT-FICT, targeting organizations with hybrid cloud and on-premise environments. APT-FICT employs a multi-phase approach involving reconnaissance, exploitation, persistence, credential theft, data staging, and exfiltration, leveraging both standard and obfuscated techniques to evade detection. The campaign highlights the importance of monitoring network appliances, cloud metadata, and non-standard protocols for blue team training and defense hardening.",
