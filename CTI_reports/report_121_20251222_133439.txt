The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on the fictional APT group 'CloudPhantom', which conducted a multi-phase attack against 'FinSecure Corp.', a company specializing in online payment processing with offices in New York and London. Initial detection occurred on 2024-03-15 when anomalous network traffic was flagged by an IDS, but the attack likely began weeks earlier. The actors initiated reconnaissance by querying server banners to identify running web services and their versions [T1595.002] while simultaneously enumerating mail exchange (MX) records via DNS queries to gather victim network information [T1590]. System logs from FinSecure's perimeter firewall show increased scanning activity from IP 203.0.113.45, which was later traced to a compromised VPS in Singapore, though this detail is not directly related to the kill-chain. To establish persistence, CloudPhantom registered a front organization website to legally purchase code signing certificates for malicious use [T1588.003], allowing them to sign payloads that evaded detection. In the execution phase, they employed compromised Azure Managed Identities to access virtual machines in the cloud environment [T1078.004] and used Mimikatz.exe to extract clear-text passwords from memory for local account credential abuse [T1078.003], enabling lateral movement across on-premises systems. The spyware component monitored the Windows message queue to intercept and record keystrokes via input injection [T1674] while the backdoor executed 'sc query' to locate services vulnerable to DLL hijacking attacks through services file permissions weakness [T1574.010]. For cloud escalation, the threat actor used iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator to generate short-term credentials for temporary elevated cloud access [T1548.005] and leveraged stolen Azure credentials to interact with a virtual machine's boot diagnostics via direct cloud VM connections [T1021.008]. During data collection, they accessed victim SharePoint environments to search for VPN and MFA enrollment information, help desk instructions, and new hire guides [T1213.002] and injected malicious JavaScript into HTTP responses to execute cross-site scripting attacks through content injection [T1659]. For exfiltration, the malware uploaded documents from compromised hosts to a shared Microsoft Office 365 Outlook email account over a web service [T1567], and the attack script triggered continuous SSL/TLS session renegotiations to degrade HTTPS service performance via service exhaustion flood [T1499.002]. Incident responders noted that FinSecure's backup servers, located in a separate data center, remained unaffected, but this is irrelevant to the attack flow. The campaign was mitigated by revoking cloud credentials and implementing network segmentation, with ongoing forensic analysis.
