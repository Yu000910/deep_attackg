The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign, 'ShadowDeploy.' This group targeted a software development company, 'TechSoft Inc.,' which provides enterprise applications to global clients. Initial analysis of system logs from TechSoft's Jenkins server on 2023-10-15 revealed anomalous configuration changes, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured monitoring tools.

The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify TechSoft's software supply chain vulnerabilities. They then compromised the continuous integration server by altering its configuration to inject malicious code into software updates [T1195], distributing trojanized builds to over 500 customers. Upon execution on a macOS endpoint, the malware used Native API calls such as GetTickCount for timing-based obfuscation [T1106] to evade detection while writing a new plist file to /Library/LaunchDaemons/ to ensure persistence during system boot [T1543.004].

For lateral movement, the adversary exploited the built-in Administrator account with a weak default password to gain access to the domain controller [T1078.001], where they modified the Mach-O structure to inject a path to a malicious dylib [T1546.006]. The malware then executed cmd.exe commands to harvest credentials and centralized stolen data in a hidden directory on a staging server [T1074.002], using a custom protocol tunneled through DNS for covert communication [T1572].

C2 infrastructure was dynamically resolved via HTTP requests to download resources containing IP address and port pairs [T1568], enabling the actors to maintain stealth. In the exfiltration phase, they exploited Bluetooth RFCOMM channels to transfer stolen financial records from air-gapped systems [T1011.001]. Finally, to disrupt incident response, the group conducted a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against TechSoft's external-facing web servers [T1498], overwhelming them with traffic and delaying forensic analysis. Logs from firewall devices showed a spike in UDP packets, but initial triage misattributed this to a misconfigured network appliance.
