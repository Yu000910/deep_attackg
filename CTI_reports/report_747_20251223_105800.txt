ShadowPhish, a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, conducted a targeted campaign against financial organizations over a six-month period, leveraging cloud infrastructure and social engineering. Initial reconnaissance involved scanning public employee directories, but no specific techniques were tagged here as per instructions. The actors first acquired malicious infrastructure by deploying phishing landing pages on compromised AWS EC2 instances [T1583] to harvest credentials, while simultaneously using bruteforce.exe to gain unauthorized access to corporate email accounts [T1586.002] for trust exploitation. They developed custom capabilities, including a keylogger executable [T1587] designed to capture user inputs, and utilized valid accounts [T1078] by leveraging stolen credentials from spearphishing emails to maintain persistent access and move laterally within the network, such as logging into internal systems like the DCCC network and exploiting default passwords on IoT devices like VOIP phones. Once inside, the actors employed Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) [T1047] to query system information and gather domain group membership data [T1069.002] using commands like 'dscacheutil -q group' to identify privileged accounts. For credential capture, they deployed a malicious browser extension [T1056] that hooked into credential submission APIs to intercept passwords before encryption. Data exfiltration involved encoding stolen files into XOR-encrypted binary blobs [T1560.003] for obfuscation, then using one-way communication [T1102.003] to download additional payloads like zip files for execution, while exfiltrating data to cloud storage services such as Dropbox [T1567.002] and over command and control (C2) channels [T1041] in the same protocol as C2 communications. Incident responders noted anomalous system logs showing increased network traffic to unknown IPs, but these were not tagged as they represent noise. The campaign underscores the need for enhanced email security, monitoring of WMI activities, and restrictions on cloud storage access.
