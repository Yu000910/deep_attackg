    "clean_text": "ShadowHawk actors conducted reconnaissance to identify target domains and infrastructure, leveraging dynamic DNS providers to establish command and control (C2) infrastructure with legitimate-looking subdomains while simultaneously acquiring code signing certificates through fake business identities to sign malicious software. Initial access was achieved via hardware additions, where a USB Rubber Ducky disguised as a standard flash drive was planted in a corporate breakroom, exploiting human curiosity to execute payloads. Upon execution, the malware employed Component Object Model (COM) techniques, using Microsoft.Office.Interop objects to insert malicious macros into documents and deployed PowerShell scripts to create Azure virtual machines in unused or unsupported cloud regions with security logging disabled. Persistence and lateral movement involved credential access through Kerberoasting, utilizing tools like Rubeus and Invoke-Kerberoast to steal AES hashes from service accounts, while exfiltration and C2 communications were concealed by encoding network traffic with non-standard Base64 encoding, removing padding characters to evade detection. System logs from affected endpoints showed unusual PowerShell activity at 14:30 UTC, and background checks revealed the targeted company, 'EnergyGrid Inc.', had recently expanded its cloud footprint without updating security policies. No actual data breaches occurred in this training scenario.",
