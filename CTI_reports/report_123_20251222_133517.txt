On October 15, 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA observed suspicious activity in a financial institution's network, traced to a phishing campaign with malicious attachments. Initial analysis revealed that the actors conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify domain accounts and cloud resources, leading to the deployment of Mimikatz.exe to extract Kerberos tickets and domain credentials [T1078.002] while simultaneously creating a rogue Lambda function with a backdoor to execute unauthorized commands in the cloud environment [T1648]. The attack progressed with the adversary employing JavaScript [T1059.007] to execute additional malicious payloads, which injected code into trusted processes via the Asynchronous Procedure Call queue [T1055.004] and used process hollowing [T1055.012] to inject into target processes like Svchost and Explorer. System logs from the compromised server, running Windows Server 2019 with standard security patches, showed unusual network traffic spikes at 02:00 UTC, unrelated to the attack but noted for context. To restore command and control channels after network disruption, the malicious process launched 'reconnect_tool.exe' utilizing Domain Generation Algorithms [T1568.002], and attackers exploited Bluetooth pairing protocol weaknesses to transfer stolen credentials to a nearby device [T1011.001]. The company, a mid-sized regional bank with hybrid on-premises and AWS infrastructure, reported no financial loss but initiated incident response procedures, including isolating affected systems and reviewing cloud configurations.
