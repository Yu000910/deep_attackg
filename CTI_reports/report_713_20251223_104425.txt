The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide a fictional, educational overview of simulated malicious activity for training purposes. This report describes a campaign against 'TechCorp Solutions', a mid-sized software development company, with no real-world impact intended.

Initial Access: The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by querying public GitLab repositories [T1593.003] to identify source code containing hardcoded database credentials, which were then exploited to gain initial foothold into the corporate network. Concurrently, they leveraged a compromised DNS server [T1584] to redirect victim traffic through their controlled infrastructure, enhancing stealth and persistence.

Execution: Upon access, the adversary employed Python-based tools [T1059.006] to execute malicious scripts that downloaded additional payloads while modifying system configurations. They also used a Hypervisor CLI [T1059.012] via vim-cmd to snapshot a virtual machine for data exfiltration, demonstrating cross-platform capabilities. System logs from TechCorp's internal monitoring showed unusual Python processes running on multiple Linux servers, though these were initially flagged as benign development activity.

Persistence: To maintain access, the threat actor installed a custom systemd service [T1053.006] that launches a keylogger on boot, ensuring continuous credential harvesting. Additionally, they modified Autorun.inf files on removable media [T1091] to execute malware automatically when USB drives were inserted, facilitating lateral movement within air-gapped segments of the network.

Privilege Escalation and Credential Access: The actors ran Mimikatz.exe with the 'sekurlsa::logonpasswords' command [T1003] to dump OS credentials from memory, harvesting administrator passwords. Using stolen session tokens, they hijacked an RDP connection [T1563] to access confidential documents, while also executing Connect-MgGraph [T1021.007] to gain unauthorized access to Microsoft 365 resources for further cloud-based exploitation.

Exfiltration: For data exfiltration, the attacker used FTP [T1048] to transfer stolen database files to an external host, embedding command and control data within digital photographs using steganography tools [T1001.002] to evade detection. They scheduled transfers via PowerShell [T1029] to exfiltrate data in small, stealthy batches, minimizing network anomalies. Fallback channels [T1008] were established to switch C2 communication if primary routes were disrupted, ensuring operational resilience.

Defense Evasion: Throughout the campaign, Silent Librarian utilized free Let's Encrypt SSL certificates [T1588.004] on phishing pages to appear legitimate, reducing suspicion during initial interactions. Network traffic analysis revealed encrypted connections to domains associated with the compromised infrastructure, but routine firewall logs showed no immediate alerts due to the use of standard protocols.

Impact: This simulated activity resulted in the exfiltration of sensitive intellectual property and credential compromise, highlighting the need for robust monitoring and response procedures. TechCorp's incident response team, upon review, identified gaps in their security posture, such as inadequate code review practices and weak endpoint protection on virtualized environments.
