The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training insights into a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign, designated APT-99, targeting retail organizations. This report is based on simulated incident data from a fictional victim, 'RetailCorp Inc.', a mid-sized e-commerce company specializing in seasonal goods. Analysis of system logs from RetailCorp's SIEM indicated anomalous network traffic patterns beginning in early October, coinciding with their peak holiday shopping season, though initial alerts were dismissed as false positives due to high user activity. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by searching the victim's publicly available Facebook page to map out seasonal business fluctuations and identify peak operational periods [T1591.003], while simultaneously gathering passive DNS information through analysis of historical DNS query logs to enumerate subdomains and infrastructure details [T1590.002]. Following initial access via a compromised vendor email account (not attributed to a specific technique in this scenario), the adversary executed Mimikatz.exe on an internal workstation to extract NTLM hashes and plaintext passwords from local account sessions, leveraging these credentials for lateral movement [T1078.003]. To evade detection, APT-99 employed AutoHotKey scripts to write malicious .ahk files that disabled security software before encrypting files with ransomware [T1059.010], and used Cobalt Strike with configured HTTP Host Header values to enable domain fronting for command and control communications, masking traffic within legitimate CDN services [T1090.004]. Additionally, the actors deployed OnionDuke modules to conduct endpoint denial of service attacks, overwhelming system resources and disrupting business operations during critical sales events [T1499]. Incident responders noted that RetailCorp's backup systems were partially affected, but full restoration was achieved after 72 hours, with no evidence of data exfiltration beyond encrypted files. This fictional scenario underscores the importance of monitoring social media footprints, securing local accounts, and implementing network segmentation to mitigate similar real-world threats.
