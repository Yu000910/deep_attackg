The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training insights into a fictional APT campaign dubbed 'Shadow Serpent.' This actor has been observed targeting financial organizations in the U.S., leveraging a blend of social engineering and technical exploits. Initial reconnaissance involved monitoring victims via a fabricated Twitter account [T1585.001] to gather intelligence on key personnel and organizational structure. System logs from early June show unusual DNS queries to external domains, but these were initially dismissed as benign noise. The attack commenced with spearphishing voice calls [T1566.004], where adversaries impersonated IT support to trick employees into downloading a malicious RMM tool, which was then used to gain initial access. Once inside, the actors executed a malicious Excel spreadsheet that displayed a fake 'Document Recovery' prompt, and when users clicked 'Enable Content,' it triggered PowerShell commands to copy and paste malicious code into memory [T1204.004]. Internal network scans revealed anomalous traffic spikes during this phase, though no alerts were triggered due to misconfigured firewalls. For persistence and lateral movement, the adversaries modified Group Policy Objects [T1484.001] to deploy scheduled tasks across the domain, while simultaneously using software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy [T1072] to distribute AvosLocker ransomware and other utilities. Discovery activities included issuing commands such as 'net accounts /domain' to assess password policies [T1201] and 'net user' to enumerate accounts [T1087], alongside 'net group /domain' to identify privileged domain groups [T1069.002]. Command and control was established through DNS tunneling [T1071.004], with C2 servers masquerading as legitimate cloud services, evading initial detection. The campaign culminated in endpoint denial-of-service attacks [T1499], where malware exploited a resource exhaustion vulnerability in a web application framework, causing service disruptions. Post-incident analysis uncovered residual artifacts in registry keys and temporary files, but these were not immediately actionable during the attack.
