APT-99 likely initiated operations by querying a paid threat intelligence feed to gather intelligence on the target's email infrastructure [T1597.001] and subsequently sent a phishing email disguised as a password reset request from the IT department to gather victim identity information [T1589]. The malware then queried the company's 'About Us' page to collect employee names for spear-phishing [T1589.003], while the threat actor uploaded a PowerShell backdoor script to a private GitHub repository for later retrieval [T1608]. In the next phase, Lumma Stealer was delivered through phishing emails containing malicious links [T1566.002], and the malware leveraged SCCM to run a PowerShell script that collected system information from connected workstations [T1072]. APT42 has used the PowerShell-based POWERPOST script to collect local account names from the victim machine [T1087.001], and the attacker used WinRM to remotely execute commands on the target Windows system [T1021.006]. LuminousMoth has used ARP spoofing to redirect a compromised machine to an actor-controlled website [T1557.002], and WARPWIRE can capture credentials submitted during the web logon process to access layer seven applications such as RDP [T1056.003]. The adversary used PowerShell to query IMAP servers for email metadata [T1114], and Linfo creates a backdoor through which remote attackers can change C2 servers [T1008]. Sibot communicated with its C2 server via HTTP GET requests [T1071.001], while OpenSSL encrypted the collected network topology maps before transmission [T1048.002]. Finally, the ransomware extracted sensitive_docs.zip from the network share before encryption [T1020]. System logs from the target environment showed routine backup processes and user login attempts, which were unrelated to the attack. The company, a mid-sized financial services firm, had recently updated its firewall policies, but this did not prevent the initial breach.
