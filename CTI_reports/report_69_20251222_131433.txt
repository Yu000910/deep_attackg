On October 15, 2024, network administrators at GlobalTech Solutions, a mid-sized technology firm specializing in industrial control systems, discovered anomalous network traffic during a routine audit. Initial investigation revealed a passive Ethernet tap [T1200] installed in the server room, likely placed by an intruder posing as maintenance personnel two weeks prior. System logs from October 10 showed unusual WMI activity originating from a compromised workstation, where the adversary employed Windows Management Instrumentation [T1047] to execute remote commands and move laterally across the network while simultaneously scheduling a malicious Kubernetes CronJob with elevated privileges [T1053.007] to deploy containers for persistent access. On macOS endpoints, forensic analysis uncovered a script that queried securityd memory [T1555.002] to extract keychain passwords and used these credentials to abuse PiKVM hardware [T1219.003] for remote, hardware-level control over critical servers. Between October 12 and 14, the threat actor leveraged the AWS CLI [T1537] to transfer intellectual property from S3 buckets to an adversary-owned AWS account and utilized FTP [T1048] to exfiltrate financial records to a malicious host. On October 14, malware executed 'Set-LocalUser -Name 'adminuser' -Enabled $false' [T1531] to disable administrative accounts and overwrote files with random data before deletion [T1561.001] to wipe disk content and hinder recovery efforts. GlobalTech's incident response team noted no prior alerts from their SIEM, highlighting gaps in monitoring for hardware intrusions and container-based attacks. The company, founded in 2005, reported no financial impact but emphasized the need for enhanced physical security and endpoint detection.
