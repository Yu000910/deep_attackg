On October 26, 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign designated 'Magic Hound' targeting financial institutions in North America. This report is for educational purposes to enhance blue team readiness. The campaign began in early 2023, with initial reconnaissance observed via LinkedIn profile scraping, though no specific techniques are tagged here as it's background noise. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify targets, then employed spearphishing via WhatsApp [T1566.003] to deliver malicious links while simultaneously using service execution via a PsExec-like tool [T1569.002] to deploy payloads on compromised systems. System logs from victim environments show unusual SSH activity starting at 14:32 UTC, with the adversary modifying sshd_config to enable password authentication and adding SSH authorized keys [T1098.004] for persistent access, alongside placing a malicious DLL named portmon.dll in the system drivers directory [T1547.010] to hijack port monitors. During exfiltration, the group used WinRAR [T1560.001] to archive collected files and memory dumps, then transmitted data over TCP raw sockets [T1095] to avoid detection by standard network security tools. Additional irrelevant log entries include routine backup processes and user login attempts that are not part of the attack chain. The campaign's infrastructure was traced to fictional IP addresses in a non-cooperative region, with no further actionable intelligence available.
