On October 15, 2023, a fictional organization, TechGlobal Inc., reported anomalous network activity leading to the discovery of a sophisticated intrusion. TechGlobal Inc., a mid-sized software development company with offices in New York and London, experienced unusual spikes in network traffic during off-peak hours, as logged in their SIEM system (Event ID 4688). Initial investigation revealed that an adversary, likely APT-99, conducted reconnaissance by passively monitoring network communications using a hardware network tap inserted into an unsecured server room [T1200]. This allowed the actors to capture unencrypted credentials from LDAP authentication packets. Subsequently, the actors abused schtasks.exe to schedule execution of a malicious payload, spyware.exe, during off-peak business hours [T1053], while simultaneously modifying the ~/.bash_profile on Linux servers to establish persistence by running a backdoor on shell startup [T1546.004]. The malware then collected sensitive information from Microsoft SharePoint services, including project documents and user permissions [T1213.002], and accessed team collaboration notes and meeting minutes from the Confluence repository [T1213.001]. Additionally, the Trojan.Karagany variant was deployed to capture keystrokes on compromised hosts [T1056.001], and the actors used web services such as Paste.ee to host and distribute payloads for command and control [T1102]. Logs from the firewall (Cisco ASA) showed multiple outbound connections to suspicious IP addresses, but no further lateral movement was detected at this stage.
