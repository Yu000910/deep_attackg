APT-99, a fictional advanced persistent threat group, likely conducted reconnaissance by searching a private threat intelligence portal for employee email addresses [T1597.001] and analyzing public DNS records to map subdomains and IP addresses [T1590.003]. Initial access was achieved by exploiting the Guest account, which was enabled by default on the victim's Windows servers [T1078.001]. Once inside, the adversary employed a Visual Basic script placed in the Startup folder to deploy Smoke Loader [T1059.005], which then abused Windows Dynamic Data Exchange for inter-process communication to execute malicious commands [T1559] and ran a PowerShell script, host_info.ps1, to collect system information such as hostname, IP address, and installed software [T1104]. In the final stage, the malware deployed Hermes ransomware to encrypt files using AES256 encryption [T1486], causing operational disruption. Logs from the victim's SIEM showed unusual login attempts from IP 192.168.1.100 at 03:00 UTC, but no alerts were triggered due to misconfigured thresholds. The company, a mid-sized bank, had recently migrated to cloud infrastructure, which may have introduced vulnerabilities in access controls.
