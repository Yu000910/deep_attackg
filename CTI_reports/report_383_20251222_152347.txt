The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a simulated advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign, designated 'ShadowVeil'. This fictional scenario is based on observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to enhance defensive capabilities. Background: The target organization, 'FinSecure Bank', is a mid-sized financial institution with operations across North America. System logs from their SIEM showed unusual DNS activity starting on 2024-10-01, but initial triage dismissed it as benign. The campaign began with reconnaissance, where the actors likely conducted passive DNS analysis [T1596.001] to map the organization's infrastructure, followed by sending spearphishing emails through Gmail [T1598.001] to key employees in the IT department, which led to initial access. Upon execution, the adversary used a malicious USB drive to deploy njRAT [T1091], which then leveraged AppleScript [T1059.002] to establish persistence by creating a login item on macOS systems, while simultaneously gathering network configuration details [T1016] and querying local groups [T1069.001] to identify administrative accounts. The malware, identified as a variant of 'SysUpdate', collected information on running processes [T1057] and employed socket filters [T1205.002] to optimize data handling, alongside using DNS calculation techniques [T1568.003] to bypass egress filtering by embedding data in MX record queries. For exfiltration, the actors transmitted stolen financial data over command and control (C2) channels [T1041] and exploited Bluetooth protocol flaws [T1011.001] to covertly send records to an external receiver. Additional logs from FinSecure's firewall indicated increased outbound traffic to suspicious IP addresses, but no alerts were triggered due to misconfigured rules. This scenario underscores the importance of monitoring for blended TTPs and implementing robust network segmentation.
