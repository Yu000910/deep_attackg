On October 15, 2023, a fictional financial institution 'SecureBank Corp.' reported anomalous activity. ShadowNet, a simulated advanced persistent threat group, initiated reconnaissance by browsing to a CDN lookup service to gather intelligence on SecureBank's content delivery network [T1596.004]. Concurrently, the actor staged capabilities by uploading a malicious PowerShell script to a private GitHub repository for later deployment [T1608]. In the initial access phase, phishing messages posing as Microsoft Teams notifications were sent to compromise corporate social media account credentials [T1586.001], while malware was configured to automatically connect to any open Wi-Fi access point named 'Free_WiFi' to facilitate network infiltration [T1669]. Upon execution, PoetRAT was deployed using spearphishing attachments to infect victims [T1204.002], and persistence was established by dropping a suspicious DLL named 'printmon.dll' into the spool drivers directory to act as a port monitor [T1547.010]. During discovery, the adversary employed SVCReady to collect time zone information [T1124] and performed Active Directory enumeration of victim environments to assess domain trust [T1482]. For command and control, multi-stage channels were utilized, with the threat actor running 'host_info.ps1' to gather detailed system configuration data for C2 optimization [T1104]. Finally, for impact, BlackCat was used to change the desktop wallpaper on compromised hosts as part of an internal defacement strategy [T1491.001]. System logs from SecureBank showed routine database backups at 2:00 AM EST, unrelated to the attack. The company, founded in 1995, specializes in digital banking services across North America.
