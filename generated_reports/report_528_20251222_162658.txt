The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide information on a fictional threat actor, 'ShadowCipher', observed conducting sophisticated attacks against hybrid environments. Initial reconnaissance likely involved scanning for vulnerable cloud accounts and network endpoints, though specific logs from firewall IDS-001 show normal traffic patterns during this phase. The actors first gained initial access by exploiting compromised Office 365 service accounts with Global Administrator privileges [T1078.004] to collect sensitive emails from user inboxes while simultaneously deploying a fraudulent SSL certificate to C:\ProgramData\cert.pem for man-in-the-middle operations [T1608.003]. Execution involved using PowerShell scripts to deploy a malicious container pod that mounted its node's root file system [T1610], establishing a reverse shell for persistent access. The malware then created a systemd service named 'logrotate.service' with an ExecStart command to run a remote access tool [T1543.002] and hooked into Windows Credential Provider APIs to harvest login credentials [T1056.004]. For persistence and defense evasion, the adversary conducted ARP spoofing to capture unencrypted credentials over the network [T1557] and employed port knocking via raw sockets to maintain stealthy communication channels [T1205.001]. System logs from server SRV-203 indicate increased CPU usage but no immediate alerts. Exfiltration was achieved by automatically saving stolen credentials to an external hard drive connected to the infected system [T1052], with network traffic analysis showing spikes in data transfer to unknown IPs. Impact activities included exploiting an unpatched IIS vulnerability to cause service unavailability [T1499] and executing a 'format C:' command to wipe the primary hard drive, rendering the system unusable [T1561]. Incident responders noted that backup systems were offline due to scheduled maintenance, complicating recovery efforts.
