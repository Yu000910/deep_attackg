Crimson Viper, a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has been observed targeting energy sector organizations in a simulated campaign designed for cybersecurity training. The group's activities align with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly used in real-world attacks, though all details herein are fabricated for educational purposes. Initial reconnaissance involved scraping the victim's public-facing website, specifically the 'Contact Us' page, to gather physical office locations [T1591.001]. This information likely informed subsequent social engineering efforts. Following reconnaissance, the actors conducted a spearphishing campaign, delivering malicious email attachments disguised as routine business documents, such as invoices or reports, to targeted employees [T1566.001]. One such attachment was a .docx file that exploited Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) auto-links to silently download and execute a secondary payload from a remote server [T1559.002]. Upon execution, the payload deployed a malicious script that manipulated system power settings using powercfg.exe to disable automatic shutdowns and maintain persistence on compromised hosts [T1653]. For lateral movement within the network, the actors employed ARP cache poisoning to intercept and analyze network traffic, identifying active hosts and potential targets for further exploitation [T1557.002]. Command and control (C2) communications were obfuscated through domain fronting, where Cobalt Strike beacons used manipulated HTTP Host Headers to route traffic through legitimate content delivery networks, evading network-based detection [T1090.004]. Throughout the campaign, Crimson Viper leveraged these techniques in a coordinated manner, emphasizing the need for robust monitoring and response protocols. Additional logs from the simulated environment show routine system updates and user login activities, which are unrelated to the attack but highlight the importance of distinguishing normal from malicious behavior. The organization's background includes operations across multiple states, with an IT infrastructure comprising Windows and Linux servers, though these details do not directly correlate with the tagged techniques.
