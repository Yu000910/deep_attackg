The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with a realistic training scenario based on fictional threat activity. CrimsonViper, a cybercriminal group, likely conducted reconnaissance by collecting email addresses [T1589.002] of targeted employees at a social media firm, while simultaneously purchasing a custom ransomware builder from an underground forum [T1588] and signing up for multiple Azure free accounts to create redundant infrastructure [T1583] for their operations. In the initial access phase, the actors created fake Instagram profiles to send malicious links disguised as photo album invitations via spearphishing [T1566.003], which led to the execution of a malicious script that used schtasks.exe to schedule recurring tasks [T1053] for credential harvesting. Upon execution, the adversary employed Lua code [T1059.011] to establish a reverse shell connection, while using klist queries to analyze Ccache files [T1558.005] for silver ticket forgery opportunities. For persistence and credential access, they utilized pwdumpx.exe to dump password hashes from the Security Account Manager [T1003.002] and hijacked SSH agent sockets [T1563.001] to reuse existing connections for lateral movement across the network. During collection, the malware included a module that gathered documents from removable media [T1025], and for defense evasion, WellMess-like obfuscation was applied by inserting junk data into Base64 strings [T1001.001]. Command and control was maintained through traffic signaling [T1205], where custom TCP packets were crafted to open hidden backdoor ports. In the impact phase, the backdoor injected 'evil.ps1' to modify operating system color schemes as a form of defacement [T1491], and XMRig mining software was installed to hijack GPU resources for cryptocurrency generation [T1496]. System logs from the victim environment showed normal user activity during off-hours, with no immediate alerts triggered, highlighting the need for enhanced monitoring. The company, a mid-sized social media platform, reported no actual data loss, but this scenario underscores the importance of training against multi-vector attacks.
