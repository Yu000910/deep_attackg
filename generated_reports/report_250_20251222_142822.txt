The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on the fictional APT group 'SHADOWMESH,' which has been observed targeting entertainment and technology companies since early 2024. This campaign begins with actors conducting reconnaissance by creating a counterfeit Instagram account impersonating a celebrity to extract personal data from fans, enabling targeted spearphishing [T1598.001]. Subsequently, the group compromises software dependencies by modifying a malicious.dll within a popular open-source library to enable covert data collection, which is then distributed via spearphishing attachments in emails that appear to originate from trusted sources [T1195.001, T1566.001]. Upon execution, these attachments deliver a malicious file that, when opened by victims, triggers the deployment of Ramsay malware, exploiting vulnerabilities in document macros [T1204.002]. Post-execution, the malware employs the Hypervisor CLI via esxcli to list all virtual machines and identify high-value targets within the virtualized environment, while simultaneously loading a malicious kernel extension using kextload to establish persistence and evade detection [T1059.012, T1547.006]. To maintain access across hybrid infrastructures, adversaries modify the AzureADConnectAuthenticationAgentService registry keys, ensuring persistent cloud access and enabling lateral movement through Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) exploitation in Microsoft Excel to run malicious code on remote machines [T1556.007, T1021.003]. Network manipulation is achieved by executing a fake DHCP service to intercept and log all DHCP discover requests, facilitating man-in-the-middle attacks and data interception [T1557.003]. Data theft involves leveraging git commands to extract proprietary software code from internal version control systems, while keylogging threads capture all keyboard events and write them to predefined log files for credential harvesting [T1213.003, T1056.001]. Exfiltration is conducted using Remote Desktop Software like TeamViewer for interactive remote control and exfiltrating data to code repositories such as GitHub, mimicking legitimate traffic to avoid detection [T1219.002, T1567.001]. Finally, the campaign concludes with internal defacement, where taunting images and messages are left on victims' desktops as proof of system access, aimed at causing disruption and psychological impact [T1491.001]. System logs from affected organizations show increased network traffic to unknown IP addresses, but no actual data breaches have occurred in this training scenario. Background checks reveal that 'SHADOWMESH' is a fictional construct based on real-world TTPs, with no known affiliations to state-sponsored groups.
