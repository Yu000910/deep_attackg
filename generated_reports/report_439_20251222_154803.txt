The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to detail a simulated campaign by the fictional threat actor 'Cobalt Serpent' against 'InnovateCorp', a mid-sized technology company specializing in cloud software solutions. This report is based on a fictional scenario designed for blue team training and does not reflect real-world events.

Initial Access: The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by querying InnovateCorp's official blog to identify business tempo, including product release schedules [T1591.003]. System logs from the corporate web server show increased traffic from IP addresses associated with known proxy services, but no malicious activity was detected at this stage. Following this, the adversary gained physical access to an InnovateCorp office and used a USB Rubber Ducky to deliver a payload that established remote access [T1200]. The device was plugged into a workstation in the marketing department, which had outdated antivirus software, allowing the payload to execute without immediate detection.

Execution: Once remote access was established, the attacker employed the command-line interface to execute malicious commands via cloud APIs, specifically targeting and disabling security software on the compromised machine [T1059.009]. InnovateCorp's security team noted anomalous process terminations in their SIEM logs, but initial alerts were dismissed as false positives due to routine maintenance activities.

Persistence: To maintain persistence, the adversary placed a malicious payload in %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\oci.dll so it would be sideloaded by the MSDTC service [T1574.001]. This technique allowed the malware to execute each time the service started, blending with legitimate system processes. Network traffic analysis revealed unusual DLL loads from the SYSTEM32 directory, but these were not flagged by default security policies.

Defense Evasion: The malware employed extra window memory injection by writing malicious.dll into the memory space of explorer.exe to execute code [T1055.011], evading traditional file-based detection mechanisms. Additionally, the actors used credential API hooking to hook the GetClipboardData function, capturing clipboard contents containing authentication tokens [T1056.004]. This enabled the theft of credentials without triggering standard anti-malware scans. System performance logs indicated slight memory spikes in explorer.exe, but these were attributed to user activity.

Discovery: For network reconnaissance, the tool monitored broadcast traffic to find ARP requests, revealing network topology through ARP cache poisoning [T1557.002]. This allowed the adversary to map internal systems and identify high-value targets, such as file servers and domain controllers. InnovateCorp's network monitoring tools detected irregular ARP packets but did not correlate them with other suspicious activities.

Lateral Movement: The ransomware used the SMB protocol to spread across the network, mimicking legitimate file server communications [T1071], facilitating lateral movement to other systems. This activity was masked by normal SMB traffic during business hours, delaying detection. Endpoint logs showed unauthorized file accesses, but initial investigations focused on user error rather than malicious intent.

This campaign highlights the importance of multi-layered defense strategies, including physical security controls, endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, and network segmentation. Blue teams should practice identifying and mitigating these techniques in controlled environments to improve incident response capabilities.
