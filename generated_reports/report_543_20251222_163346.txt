Storm-1811, a fictional advanced persistent threat group, has been observed targeting large enterprises in the financial and technology sectors. The attack began with reconnaissance, where actors gathered employee information from public sources like LinkedIn and company websites, though no specific technique tags apply to this generic activity. Initial access was achieved through spearphishing via Microsoft Teams [T1566.003], where the actors posed as IT support personnel to send malicious links, initiating voice calls to increase credibility. Upon execution, the adversary employed Component Object Model (COM) objects [T1559.001] to create scheduled tasks for persistence while simultaneously deploying a Password Filter DLL [T1556.002] that monitored credential input fields across applications, logging keystrokes to capture domain admin passwords. System logs from the victim's Windows Event Viewer showed unusual process creations at 03:14:22 UTC, but these were not directly tied to tagged techniques. For credential access, the actors collected web session cookies [T1550.004] from browser storage to bypass multi-factor authentication, enabling unauthorized access to cloud services. Lateral movement was facilitated using Software Deployment Tools like SCCM [T1072] to deploy a malicious Group Policy Object that executed commands on all domain computers, while also leveraging SharePoint permissions [T1213.002] to access and exfiltrate customer databases stored in collaborative platforms. The company, a mid-sized tech firm with offices in New York and London, reported network slowdowns during peak hours, unrelated to the attack. For command and control, the threat actor implemented traffic signaling [T1205] by using libpcap to monitor for specific traffic patterns that would activate normally dormant malicious ports, ensuring stealthy communication. Exfiltration occurred over encrypted channels, with data masked as routine backup traffic, though no additional techniques were tagged in this phase. The attack concluded with the actors covering tracks by deleting logs and using legitimate admin tools, highlighting the need for robust monitoring and response protocols.
