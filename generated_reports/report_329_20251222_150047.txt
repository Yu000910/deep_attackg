On March 15, 2024, a financial institution reported suspicious activity after employees received phone calls from individuals impersonating IT support, directing them to download a remote monitoring tool [T1566.004]. Concurrently, the adversary exploited a vulnerability in the organization's public-facing VPN application to deploy malicious binaries [T1190]. Once initial access was achieved, users were tricked by a fake error message prompting them to copy and paste a malicious command disguised as a repair tool [T1204.004]. The actors then employed native Windows API calls [T1106] to gather system information and inject code into running processes via VDSO hijacking [T1055.014]. They leveraged default administrator accounts with weak credentials to escalate privileges and deploy payloads [T1078.001], while forging web credentials to access cloud resources [T1606]. To maintain stealth, the backdoor used libpcap to sniff network traffic and dynamically adjust its listening ports based on patterns [T1205]. Finally, the threat actor overwrote critical system files through administrative shares to corrupt the disk [T1561], causing operational disruption. Logs from the VPN server showed unusual connection attempts at 02:00 UTC, and the company's background includes a recent merger that may have introduced security gaps, though these details are unrelated to the tagged techniques.
