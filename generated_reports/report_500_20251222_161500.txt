Background: The fictional APT group 'Cloud Phantom' has been observed targeting mid-sized financial institutions in North America since early 2024. The group's motives appear financial, with a focus on stealing customer data and transaction logs. Initial reports from a simulated incident at 'SecureBank Corp' indicate unauthorized access to cloud infrastructure and data exfiltration. System logs from SecureBank show unusual spikes in Lambda function invocations and SMB traffic during off-hours, though some of these alerts were later attributed to scheduled maintenance tasks unrelated to the attack.

Attack Narrative: The actors likely conduct reconnaissance to identify key employees, though specific details are omitted here. The campaign began with spearphishing emails containing malicious links [T1566.002] that directed victims to a compromised website hosting a credential-harvesting page. Upon compromise, the adversary established persistence by creating a rogue Lambda function in the victim's AWS environment [T1648], which was used to execute unauthorized commands and deploy additional payloads while evading traditional endpoint detection. Concurrently, the group employed a tool to intercept one-time passwords [T1111], bypassing multi-factor authentication to gain deeper access to internal systems. Once inside, they leveraged SMB session hijacking [T1071.002] to relay commands through authenticated connections, blending with legitimate file-sharing traffic. To maintain stealth, the actors used custom HTTP headers to encode command and control instructions [T1001.003], making malicious traffic appear as normal web requests. Finally, they exfiltrated encrypted system information directly over the established C2 channel [T1041], siphoning data without triggering data loss prevention alerts. Post-incident analysis at SecureBank revealed residual artifacts in cloud logs, but no evidence of lateral movement beyond the initial compromised accounts.
