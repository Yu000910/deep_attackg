Background: ShadowVeil, a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has been observed targeting financial organizations in North America and Europe since early 2024. Their operations focus on stealing intellectual property and customer data. This report is based on simulated incident response logs from a fictional victim, 'Global Finance Corp', which reported unusual network activity on March 15, 2024. System logs from their Azure environment showed spikes in PowerShell usage, but initial scans flagged no malware.

Kill-Chain Analysis:
- Initial Access: The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify weak points, though this is not directly observed in logs. They compromised the software development pipeline at a third-party vendor, injecting a malicious script 'evil.ps1' into build tools to harvest environment variables [T1195.001]. This allowed them to steal credentials and gain initial foothold into Global Finance Corp's network.
- Execution: Upon access, the adversary employed PowerShell [T1059.001] to execute commands delivered through Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) in a weaponized Word document, mimicking APT28 tactics to deploy payloads like 'JHUHUGIT' [T1559.002]. They simultaneously downloaded additional tools [T1105] and modified the PATH environment variable to ensure their malicious version of 'net.exe' would execute instead of the legitimate system one [T1574.007], while masquerading files as legitimate Adobe Content Management System resources to avoid suspicion [T1036.005].
- Persistence and Defense Evasion: To maintain access, ShadowVeil used stolen SSL certificates for their command and control (C2) domains, obtained through prior campaigns [T1588.004]. They deployed 'remote_access_tool.exe' to establish persistent multi-stage C2 channels [T1104] and employed indicator removal techniques by deleting created WMI objects to evade detections [T1070]. Network logs show anomalous XMPP traffic, where compromised credentials were transmitted through private messages disguised as legitimate chat traffic using publish/subscribe protocols [T1071.005].
- Discovery and Exfiltration: The actors conducted system network configuration discovery to retrieve internal IP addresses of compromised hosts [T1016] and leveraged cloud service dashboards, such as GCP Command Center, to discover storage buckets with weak access controls [T1538]. Finally, they used USB devices to exfiltrate collected system information and network configurations from the compromised machine [T1052.001], completing the data theft phase.

Recommendations: Blue teams should monitor for unusual PowerShell activity, review software dependencies, and enforce strict access controls on cloud resources. This fictional scenario underscores the importance of layered defense strategies.
