    "clean_text": "ShadowVeil actors initiated their campaign by querying public data breach repositories to obtain compromised credentials for target email accounts, which were then used to gain initial access through spear-phishing emails. The actors employed Cloudflare Workers to obfuscate command and control (C2) communications with encrypted channels while simultaneously downloading a collection of browser exploits from a criminal hosting service at http://exploit-farm.net/chrome_pack.rar. These exploits were leveraged in drive-by compromises to infect victims with malware, such as a variant of IMAPLoader, when users visited strategically compromised websites. System logs from the target network show increased HTTP requests to unknown domains during this phase, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to encrypted traffic patterns. Upon execution, the malware created and ran a service to maintain persistence, using Python scripts for port scanning and building reverse shells while exploiting processor cache timing attacks to recover encrypted data from hardware security modules. The actors activated a Wi-Fi Pineapple to perform SSL stripping and intercept unencrypted communications in local networks, though this was limited to physical access scenarios. For lateral movement, ShadowVeil used SMB to connect to Windows admin shares, moving across the network to access sensitive file servers. The backdoor utilized Tor routing to anonymize C2 connections and hide the infrastructure's true IP addresses, with exfiltration conducted over asymmetric encrypted non-C2 protocols by sending collected data via HTTPS requests to password-protected archives staged on compromised OWA servers. Network monitoring tools recorded unusual spikes in outbound traffic to Tor exit nodes, but initial investigations focused on internal firewall rules rather than external proxy services.",

The campaign involves credential harvesting, exploit deployment, lateral movement, and data exfiltration using a combination of cloud-based obfuscation, service execution, and encrypted protocols. Blue teams should review logs for suspicious SMB connections, Python script executions, and anomalous network traffic to Tor nodes or Cloudflare Workers.",
