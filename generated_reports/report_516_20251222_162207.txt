APT-CS, a simulated advanced persistent threat group, conducted a multi-phase campaign against a fictional critical infrastructure organization, 'InfraCorp', to exfiltrate sensitive data and establish persistence. The actors began by performing active scanning [T1595] using ICMP address mask requests to map the target's subnet configuration, while simultaneously collecting detailed network diagrams from a commercial threat intelligence provider [T1597] to identify vulnerabilities. They then exploited a compromised ISP channel to inject malicious content [T1659], redirecting user traffic through a proxy to deliver a malicious LNK file, which relied on user execution [T1204] when an employee interacted with it, triggering the initial compromise. Upon gaining access, the malware, dubbed 'ShadowHook', executed PowerShell scripts to capture environmental variables [T1082] and enumerate network connections [T1049] on the compromised host. The actors used Windows Explorer to manually copy malicious files over SMB [T1021.002] to lateral move across the network, while leveraging Visual Studio Code's integrated terminal to establish a persistent command and control channel [T1219.001]. Finally, they exfiltrated stolen data using Rclone to cloud storage [T1567.002] before deploying a simulated ransomware payload. InfraCorp's security logs showed routine system updates and user login attempts, with no immediate alerts during the initial phases, highlighting the need for enhanced monitoring of network traffic and user behavior.
