The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with a realistic training scenario based on fictional APT activity. The campaign, dubbed 'Silent Tempest', targeted Precision Manufacturing Inc., a company specializing in aerospace components with annual revenue of $50 million and 200 employees. The threat actors likely conducted reconnaissance by extracting supplier information from the victim's 'Vendors' section on their official website [T1591.002] and utilized passive DNS feeds to correlate domain activity and identify related infrastructure [T1590.002]. During Operation Dust Storm, the threat actors sent spearphishing emails containing a malicious link [T1566.002] to key personnel, which led to the exploitation of vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-10271 and CVE-2018-2894 [T1203] to execute malicious scripts. System logs from the victim's environment showed increased network traffic on port 443 during off-peak hours, unrelated to the attack. The adversary employed an ARP spoofing tool obtained from GitHub [T1588.002] to intercept network communications, then used Mimikatz's sekurlsa module to dump LSA secrets [T1003.004] while simultaneously hooking the LogonUserExW API to capture domain credentials during login attempts [T1056.004]. Silent Librarian has exfiltrated entire mailboxes from compromised accounts [T1114], and sensitive files were compressed into RAR format using the rarfile module for efficient data exfiltration [T1560.002]. Network traffic was obfuscated through base64 -d encoding to avoid detection by security tools [T1001], and the attacker wrote a PowerShell script named 'malicious.ps1' to schedule data exfiltration during off-peak hours [T1029]. Precision Manufacturing Inc.'s internal investigation noted no prior security incidents in the last quarter, but this campaign highlights the need for enhanced monitoring of supply chain relationships.
