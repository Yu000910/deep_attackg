The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight a fictional APT campaign for educational purposes. Chimera, a threat actor with suspected ties to fictional regions, has been observed targeting financial organizations in the United States. The campaign began with the actor searching the National Vulnerability Database for recently disclosed software flaws [T1588.006] to identify potential entry points. Concurrently, they modified a compromised website's HTML to include hidden div elements with popular product names, enhancing search engine rankings to lure victims [T1608.006]. On May 15, 2024, system logs from the target organization, 'FinSecure Corp.', showed an increase in traffic to the poisoned site, though no immediate alerts were triggered. The actors then sent a phishing email with a malicious .docm attachment to employees, exploiting embedded macros for initial access [T1566], which was opened by a user in the accounting department, leading to the execution of a PowerShell script that downloaded additional payloads. The malicious script monitored keyboard events by hooking into the Windows message queue to capture input [T1674], while using compromised domain accounts [T1078.002] to move laterally within the network and execute mofcomp.exe to compile and load a malicious MOF file into the WMI repository for persistence [T1546.003]. A credential harvesting tool was deployed, locating and copying Chrome browser login data from local profiles [T1555], and PowerShell commands were used to configure Exchange transport rules that forwarded executive communications to an unauthorized mailbox [T1114.003]. During exfiltration, the actors hex-encoded PII data prior to transfer [T1560.003] and used DHCP spoofing to redirect client traffic through an attacker-controlled proxy [T1557.003]. For command and control, the malware wrote encrypted commands to a USB drive for physical transfer [T1092] and employed SSL for encrypting communications [T1573.002]. Finally, the malware established a botnet of compromised IoT devices to launch a coordinated DDoS attack against the corporate network [T1498], causing temporary service disruptions. FinSecure Corp.'s incident response team noted unusual network latency spikes during this phase, but the attack was contained within the training environment. This scenario underscores the importance of multi-layered defense strategies and regular security awareness training.
