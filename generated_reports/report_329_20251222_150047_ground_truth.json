    "clean_text": "On March 15, 2024, a financial institution reported suspicious activity after employees received phone calls from individuals impersonating IT support, directing them to download a remote monitoring tool. Concurrently, the adversary exploited a vulnerability in the organization's public-facing VPN application to deploy malicious binaries. Once initial access was achieved, users were tricked by a fake error message prompting them to copy and paste a malicious command disguised as a repair tool. The actors then employed native Windows API calls to gather system information and inject code into running processes via VDSO hijacking. They leveraged default administrator accounts with weak credentials to escalate privileges and deploy payloads, while forging web credentials to access cloud resources. To maintain stealth, the backdoor used libpcap to sniff network traffic and dynamically adjust its listening ports based on patterns. Finally, the threat actor overwrote critical system files through administrative shares to corrupt the disk, causing operational disruption. Logs from the VPN server showed unusual connection attempts at 02:00 UTC, and the company's background includes a recent merger that may have introduced security gaps, though these details are unrelated to the tagged techniques.",
