On 2023-10-15, a fictional energy sector company, 'NexusGrid Inc.', reported anomalous network activity following a routine software update. Initial logs from their SIEM showed unexpected Lambda function executions in AWS, correlating with increased CPU usage on Windows servers. Background: NexusGrid uses a hybrid cloud environment with CI/CD pipelines managed via Jenkins for deploying operational technology (OT) control systems. The attack began with a supply chain compromise [T1195], where adversaries infiltrated the Jenkins pipeline to inject malicious code into production artifacts, leveraging this to trigger arbitrary serverless execution [T1648] by crafting event data that activated a Lambda function designed to deploy ransomware payloads. Subsequently, the ransomware abused system services [T1569] through svchost.exe to load an encrypted malicious DLL, which facilitated data encryption across multiple endpoints. For persistence, the malware employed application shimming [T1546.011] by creating a shim database to patch services.exe, ensuring it remained active after reboots, while simultaneously collecting credential material via Ccache files [T1558.005] from user temporary directories, such as krb5cc_1000, to enable lateral movement. Additionally, the threat actors established covert communication through content injection [T1659] by embedding backdoor payloads into DNS queries, allowing persistent access without triggering traditional firewall alerts, and used port knocking [T1205.001] techniques, sniffing network traffic with libpcap libraries to identify and exploit open ports for command-and-control (C2) channels. Incident response teams noted that the attack was detected during a routine audit of Lambda function logs, which showed anomalous execution patterns not aligned with scheduled tasks.
