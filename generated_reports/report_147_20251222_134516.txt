The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the fictional APT group 'ShadowVeil'. This group has been observed targeting energy and financial sectors since early 2023, with a focus on exfiltrating sensitive operational data. Initial analysis indicates the actors likely conduct reconnaissance by searching open websites and domains [T1593] and querying threat intelligence vendors to gather employee email addresses [T1597.001], which were used in spear-phishing campaigns. In one incident, the actors compromised a software supply chain by altering source code to include backdoor capabilities before deployment [T1195.002], leveraging stolen digital certificates to sign malicious payloads [T1588.004] and staging encryption keys on virtual private servers [T1583.003] for command and control. Upon execution, the malware installed itself as a service on compromised machines [T1569.002] while simultaneously disabling cloud logs to evade detection [T1562.008] and discovering security software to assess defensive postures [T1518.001]. The actors then conducted internal reconnaissance using Wi-Fi discovery commands [T1016.002] and stole credentials stored in the registry [T1552.002], employing DHCP spoofing to redirect network traffic [T1557.003] and setting up internal proxies to obscure exfiltration paths [T1090.001]. System logs from affected organizations show anomalous network traffic spikes and failed authentication attempts, though some entries appear benign, such as routine software updates. Background checks reveal that 'ShadowVeil' has historical ties to other fictional campaigns, but no attribution to real-world entities is implied. Organizations should monitor for unusual service creations, registry modifications, and proxy configurations, as these may indicate compromise.
