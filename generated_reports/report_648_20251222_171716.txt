On October 15, 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA identified malicious activity attributed to the fictional APT group 'ShadowDNS', targeting a U.S.-based energy company, 'PowerGrid Inc.', with operations across multiple states. Initial analysis suggests the actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] through open-source intelligence gathering on employee social media profiles and network infrastructure. The attack began with the threat actor injecting a backdoor payload into DNS queries to establish persistent access [T1659] by exploiting misconfigured DNS servers at PowerGrid Inc., leading to anomalous traffic logs detected by the security team. Subsequently, the adversary employed Lua modules [T1059.011] to execute malicious scripts on compromised systems while simultaneously embedding a PowerShell script in PowerPoint's default template to maintain persistence [T1137] and evade traditional antivirus scans. In a cloud environment, the attacker added Global Administrator permissions to a low-privilege user for persistence [T1098.003] in the company's Azure AD, as noted in audit logs showing unusual role assignments. The malware then injected malicious.dll into the explorer.exe process to evade detection [T1055.002] and capture credentials by redirecting text-based login codes to websites they controlled [T1056.003], mimicking the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack. Additionally, the actors utilized Remcos-like capabilities to access a system's webcam and take pictures [T1125] for potential blackmail or intelligence gathering, with system logs indicating unauthorized camera access on an executive's laptop. For command and control (C2) communication, QakBot was observed using domain generation algorithms [T1568.002] to dynamically resolve to new domains, complicating network-based blocking efforts. PowerGrid Inc. reported no operational disruptions, but the incident highlights vulnerabilities in DNS security and endpoint protection.
