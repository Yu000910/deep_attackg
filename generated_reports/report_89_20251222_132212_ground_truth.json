    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group 'ShadowVeil'. This report is based on a simulated incident response exercise conducted in Q4 2024, involving a mid-sized energy utility company, 'GridSafe Energy', with operations across the southwestern United States. Initial detection occurred via anomalous network traffic logs from a perimeter firewall, showing unusual outbound connections to IP addresses in Southeast Asia, though subsequent analysis revealed these were part of a broader decoy strategy. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance to identify targets, though specific details are omitted for training realism.\n\nAttack Scenario: ShadowVeil actors rented multiple Virtual Private Server (VPS) instances from Vultr using stolen payment credentials to establish command and control infrastructure, which facilitated initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing WebVPN application at GridSafe Energy to achieve unauthorized remote code execution. Following exploitation, the adversary employed JavaScript to download and execute malicious payloads from the VPS while simultaneously querying Confluence repositories for API credentials stored in documentation. System logs from the affected server, dated 2024-10-15, showed increased CPU usage during this phase, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured monitoring tools. For lateral movement, the malware utilized Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) to remotely trigger malicious macros in Microsoft Access databases on networked systems, and through klist queries, the adversary determined which service tickets were available for silver ticket forgery using Ccache files. Data exfiltration involved WellMess sending files from the victim machine to the C2 server, with PowerShower encoding these communications using base64 encoding to evade detection. Incident responders noted that the company's backup systems, though operational, were not tested regularly, leading to recovery delays during the exercise. The campaign was contained after isolating affected systems and revoking compromised credentials, with no real data loss reported in this fictional scenario.",
