The actors then leveraged a large-scale botnet to target Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network devices, while simultaneously executing phishing emails that mimicked security alerts to trick users into entering their cloud credentials on a malicious site. Upon gaining access, they used stolen domain account credentials to move laterally across the network, employing Windows Management Instrumentation to extract system information and check for anti-virus presence. In parallel, the adversary set up an evil twin Wi-Fi access point to monitor traffic and executed DHCP spoofing to intercept network requests, while using IP-based geolocation to limit infections to specific regions. Collected data was archived for exfiltration using one-way communication via PowerShell scripts, and the campaign culminated in external defacement by altering the company website's index.html file. System logs from the affected environment show routine maintenance activities unrelated to the attack, and the company, a fictional retail chain, reported no actual financial losses during this training exercise.",
