On October 15, 2023, TechGlobal Inc., a company specializing in cloud infrastructure with offices in New York and London, reported anomalous network activity. Initial logs from their SIEM showed unusual login attempts from unrecognized IP addresses, but these were initially dismissed as false positives due to a recent system update. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify valid domain accounts, which they then compromised through phishing campaigns to capture credentials for lateral movement [T1078.002]. Upon gaining initial access, they employed PowerShell [T1059.001] to download a backdoor payload [T1105] from a command-and-control server, while simultaneously using svchost.exe to load a malicious DLL for remote command execution [T1569]. The adversary leveraged SharePoint permissions to access and collect strategic planning documents [T1213.002], and they created a new SSH key pair with ssh-keygen, dropping the user key in authorized_keys to enable persistent remote login [T1098.004]. For privilege escalation, they used Invoke-RunAs to create tokens and execute processes with elevated privileges [T1134.002]. During exfiltration, the actors exploited Bluetooth protocol flaws to covertly transmit stolen financial records to an external receiver [T1011.001]. Network traffic analysis revealed connections to suspicious domains, but no alerts were triggered due to misconfigured firewall rules. The incident was contained after 72 hours, with no real data loss as this was a training exercise.
