    "clean_text": "In this fictional scenario, the threat actor 'CloudScraper' initiated operations by conducting extensive reconnaissance to identify key roles and team structures within the target organization, leveraging open-source intelligence and social engineering tactics. Using compromised local accounts with known credentials, the actor executed commands and spawned processes to gain initial foothold in the network. Once inside, they exploited unsecured credentials stored in cloud services like AWS Code Build environment variables and EC2 user data, using tools such as Pacu to search for sensitive data. The actor then performed network discovery by scanning for wireless network profiles with 'netsh wlan show profiles' and conducting detailed port scans of hosts using WinEggDrop to map the network infrastructure. To escalate privileges, they gathered information on domain groups using dsquery to identify permission structures. In the execution phase, the actor gained interactive shell access to a sensitive container by running 'docker exec -it container_name /bin/bash', allowing for container administration and data extraction. For command and control, they proxied connections through ngrok web services to establish covert communication channels and leveraged Google Chrome Remote Desktop to maintain persistent remote access to compromised systems. Throughout the campaign, system logs showed normal user activity, including routine backups and software updates, which were not indicative of malicious behavior. The target organization, a mid-sized tech firm with hybrid cloud deployments, had recently migrated to AWS, but legacy systems remained in use, complicating security monitoring. This scenario underscores the importance of securing credentials, monitoring container activities, and detecting anomalous network scans and remote access tools in blue team defenses.",
