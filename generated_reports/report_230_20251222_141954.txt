The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional APT campaign. 'ShadowGate' actors likely conduct reconnaissance by searching victim-owned websites [T1594] to gather intelligence on internal network structures and exposed services. Following this, they exploit a vulnerable FortiGate device [T1190] to gain initial access, deploying malware that utilizes LoadLibraryEx to load a rogue DLL [T1129] for establishing persistence while simultaneously creating scheduled tasks [T1053.005] to maintain long-term access. Once inside, the actors employ Azure PowerShell [T1059.009] to remotely execute commands like 'Get-AzVM' for enumerating virtual machines and query the AWS instance metadata service [T1552.005] to steal cloud credentials. To facilitate command and control across air-gapped networks, they write configuration files to USB drives [T1092] and use Pastebin-hosted webpages as dead drop resolvers [T1102.001] to update C2 domains. System logs from affected organizations show increased network traffic to internal web servers, but no unauthorized access was detected in this simulated scenario. The company, a mid-sized tech firm with hybrid AWS and Azure deployments, reported no actual data loss, as this is a training exercise.
