On June 15, 2024, security teams at a fictional multinational corporation, 'Globex Corp', detected anomalous activity in their hybrid infrastructure. Globex Corp, with offices in New York and London, operates a mix of legacy on-premises systems and cloud-based Azure and Kubernetes environments. Initial logs showed unusual VPN connections from IP addresses in Eastern Europe, which were later traced to compromised employee credentials. The actors likely acquired open-source tools [T1588.002] such as Mimikatz and CrackMapExec to facilitate their operations. They exploited external remote services [T1133] by brute-forcing VPN credentials to gain initial access to the corporate network. Once inside, the adversary used infected USB keys to replicate malware [T1091] across air-gapped systems in the London office, as evidenced by Autorun.inf files found on several workstations. To escalate privileges, they abused the NSXPCConnection API to connect to a vulnerable XPC service [T1559.003], allowing them to execute arbitrary commands. The malware then employed PowerShell [T1059] to download additional payloads from command-and-control (C2) servers while simultaneously modifying registry keys for persistence. In the cloud environment, the attackers updated RoleBinding.yaml to bind a high-privilege role to a specific service account [T1098.006], providing persistent access to Kubernetes clusters. They temporarily escalated cloud access [T1548.005] by exploiting the iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role to impersonate a privileged service account, enabling them to enumerate cloud accounts [T1087.004] and download bulk lists of group members and privileged users from Azure AD. For C2 communication, the malware used symmetric cryptography [T1573.001] with hard-coded Blowfish keys, encrypting traffic to evade detection. Finally, the campaign concluded with bandwidth hijacking [T1496.002], where the malware utilized the compromised botnet to perform bandwidth exhaustion attacks against competing services, causing service degradation. Incident responders noted unrelated system logs showing routine backup failures and firewall misconfigurations that were not part of the attack.
