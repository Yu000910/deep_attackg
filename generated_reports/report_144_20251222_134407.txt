On May 15, 2024, security analysts at a fictional energy company detected anomalous network traffic originating from an internal system. The company, 'PowerGrid Inc.', operates multiple substations and has a hybrid cloud environment with VMware infrastructure. Initial investigation revealed that the threat actor, likely HYDRAQ, conducted reconnaissance by searching professional forums like Stack Overflow for employees discussing SCADA system vulnerabilities, gathering victim organization information [T1591]. Concurrently, rogue software was deployed on compromised laptops, continuously monitoring for Wi-Fi SSIDs broadcasting without encryption to identify potential entry points into air-gapped networks [T1669]. The actor then used a spear-phishing email with a malicious attachment, which executed PowerShell scripts to download a backdoor payload. This backdoor, dubbed 'HydraqLoader', created a persistent mechanism by loading and calling DLL functions through shared modules [T1129], while also writing a credential harvesting DLL to the Windows Credential Manager path to capture passwords via a password filter [T1556.002]. To maintain persistence, the malicious DLL was executed via svchost.exe modification, creating or modifying system processes [T1543]. Network logs from the DMZ showed increased traffic on port 4443, with intercepter-NG tools deployed to sniff passwords in unencrypted protocols [T1040]. The malware then performed discovery activities, querying 'net group "Domain Admins" /domain' to identify permission groups [T1069] and enumerating existing services using commands like 'sc query' for system service discovery [T1007]. In the virtualized environment, the actor executed 'esxcli software vib list' to gather information about installed VIBs and associated VMs, conducting virtual machine discovery [T1673]. For lateral movement, the threat actor replicated the backdoor through removable media by copying 'backdoor.dll' onto multiple USB drives distributed to isolated computers [T1091]. Command and control communication occurred over non-standard ports, with HTTP traffic observed on TCP ports 4443 and 10151 [T1571]. Finally, the actor encrypted critical files using the CryptEncrypt API with an RSA key, appending filenames with '.lock64' for data encrypted for impact [T1486]. Incident responders noted unrelated log entries from routine backup processes and user login attempts, which did not correlate with the attack timeline.
