On 2023-10-15, SHADOW SERPENT initiated a campaign against a fictional energy company, 'VoltGrid Inc.', by registering malicious domains [T1583.001] and utilizing virtual private servers [T1583.003] to stage encryption keys and payloads. The actors compromised the hardware supply chain [T1195.003] by distributing modified Teensy USB devices to VoltGrid's vendors, which were used to infect employee workstations upon connection. Once initial access was achieved, the adversary employed PowerShell [T1059.012] to execute vim-cmd commands, creating a new virtual machine for lateral movement within the environment while simultaneously performing network sniffing [T1040] using a custom tool similar to 'VELVETTAP' to capture packets from compromised F5 BIG-IP devices. This allowed them to conduct input capture [T1056] through credential harvesting websites, stealing SSH keys and other sensitive data. For command and control, SHADOW SERPENT used non-standard port 4050 [T1571] to establish one-way communication [T1102.003], downloading and executing additional payloads on infected machines. Finally, the actors exfiltrated the compromised SSH keys by storing them in a GitHub repository via https://api.github.com [T1567.001]. System logs from VoltGrid's SIEM showed anomalous traffic spikes on port 4050, but initial alerts were dismissed as false positives due to routine maintenance activities. Background: VoltGrid Inc. is a mid-sized utility provider with operations across the Midwest, and this incident was detected during a routine audit after employees reported unusual USB device behavior.
