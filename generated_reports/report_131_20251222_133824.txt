On 2024-03-15, our Security Operations Center (SOC) detected anomalous outbound traffic from a legacy file server (192.168.1.45) to an external IP (185.203.112.89) over port 443, which triggered an initial alert. The company, a mid-sized financial services firm with 500 employees, uses a mix of Windows servers, Linux containers, and macOS endpoints, with no prior major security incidents in the past year. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by abusing the free trial service of a secure messaging platform to set up temporary anonymous communication links for coordination [T1585.002]. They then used compromised small office/home office (SOHO) networking devices as operational command and control infrastructure to obscure their origin [T1584.008]. Initial access was achieved by exploiting a misconfigured XPC service daemon on a macOS endpoint, granting the threat actor root access to the system [T1559.003]. Once inside, they employed PowerShell to actively download a remote administration tool from the C2 server at https://c2.com/tools and saved it to the Windows system32 folder while simultaneously using default credentials for the Administrator account to propagate laterally across the network [T1608.002, T1078.001]. The malware scheduled a malicious container deployment using Kubernetes CronJob with elevated privileges to establish persistence in the cloud environment, and the script collected container execution logs to harvest credentials passed as command-line arguments during this process [T1053.007, T1552.007]. To maintain access, the adversary abused browser extensions to execute commands remotely and deployed a malicious captive portal mimicking hotel Wi-Fi to collect guest information from connected mobile devices [T1176, T1557.004]. For data collection, they used 'tree E:\ /f' to enumerate all files and directories on connected USB storage and took screenshots every five minutes, saving them to the user's local Application Data folder under `Temp\SymbolSourceSymbols\icons` [T1025, T1113]. The backdoor used libpcap to sniff network interfaces and dynamically adjust its listening ports based on traffic patterns, while Chrommme set itself to sleep before requesting new commands from C2 to avoid detection [T1205, T1029]. To obfuscate their activities, Agent Tesla had its code obfuscated using the Rijndael symmetric encryption algorithm to encrypt strings, and Cobalt Group used msxsl.exe to bypass AppLocker and invoke Jscript code from an XSL file [T1027, T1220]. Finally, the attacker executed 'sc delete SysMonitor' to remove the persistence service and cover their tracks before exfiltrating data over encrypted channels [T1070.009]. System logs from the affected Windows server showed increased CPU usage during the container deployment phase, but no alerts were triggered by the endpoint protection software due to the obfuscated payloads.
