The actors then established fake social media accounts using stolen personal information and acquired infrastructure through marketing platforms like HubSpot to obscure phishing email origins. They leveraged external remote services by exploiting VPN profiles and OWA credentials to gain initial access, followed by deploying a container to execute malicious payloads. For persistence, they used BITS jobs to launch processes and replicated through removable media to breach secure environments. Data exfiltration involved targeting cloud storage, where malware collected unencrypted financial records from exposed Amazon S3 buckets, while multi-stage channels established SOCKS5 connections for command and control. The campaign culminated in application exhaustion floods that executed sustained requests to image processing services, causing rendering delays. Logs from the victim's SIEM showed routine system updates at 03:00 UTC, unrelated to the attack, and the organization's background in regional banking with offices in three cities was used in targeting.",
