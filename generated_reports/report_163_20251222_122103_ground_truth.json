    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional attack scenario. The threat actor 'HomeLand Justice' likely conducted reconnaissance by scanning the client's network with Nmap to gather information about active hosts and client configurations, while simultaneously collecting publicly available contact information from professional networking sites such as LinkedIn. During the campaign, the actors used tools including Advanced Port Scanner, Mimikatz, and Impacket to facilitate their operations. Initial access was achieved by exploiting the default Administrator password 'admin123' on a vulnerable server, and the malware H1N1 was deployed with functionality to copy itself to removable media for lateral movement. Execution involved the attacker writing a malicious Dockerfile that included a hidden cryptocurrency miner in the build process, and persistence was established by executing assoc.exe to associate .log files with a malicious script for persistent access. The actors then employed Set-ADUser commands to alter RADIUS configuration, allowing plaintext password capture via CHAP authentication, and used a credential harvesting tool to locate and copy Chrome browser login data from the local profile. Lateral movement was conducted through winrm commands to remotely modify firewall settings on the Windows server, and command and control was maintained using a custom TCP protocol for C2 communications. Data exfiltration involved leveraging the AWS CLI to copy S3 buckets containing intellectual property to an adversary-owned AWS account, while ObliqueRAT was used to break large files of interest into smaller chunks to prepare them for exfiltration. The campaign concluded with the script injecting 'evil.ps1' to distort graphical elements in the user interface as a defacement tactic. Background noise includes system logs showing routine updates at 03:00 UTC and company details about a fictional manufacturing firm, 'TechCorp Inc.', with no direct relevance to the attack. The actors' activities were detected through anomalous network traffic patterns and elevated privilege usage alerts.",
