    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign attributed to the actor CURIUM. This report is based on a simulated attack scenario designed for training purposes and does not reflect real-world incidents. CURIUM's campaign targeted a multinational corporation, exploiting human and technical vulnerabilities to achieve persistent access and data theft.\n\nInitial reconnaissance revealed that CURIUM actors likely conducted social engineering via LinkedIn phishing to gather information on network trust dependencies, identifying inter-departmental access points and trust relationships from an employee. System logs from the corporate firewall showed increased traffic to external IPs, though this was later determined to be unrelated to the attack. The company, a mid-sized tech firm with offices in three countries, had recently implemented a new VPN solution, but misconfigurations were not exploited in this scenario.\n\nFor initial access, CURIUM compromised legitimate websites to host malicious content as part of strategic website compromise attacks, redirecting users to phishing pages that delivered payloads. Execution involved modifying the legitimate software dependency 'security.dll' to include credential harvesting functionality, which was then deployed via a supply chain attack on development tools. Network administrators later discovered a passive tap on the server room's Ethernet line, indicating hardware additions for data interception. Routine maintenance logs from the previous week showed no anomalies in server uptime.\n\nPersistence was achieved through device registration in Entra ID to maintain access after password changes, allowing the actors to bypass authentication controls. Execution continued with the use of Windows Script Host (VBScript) to run arbitrary shellcode, while simultaneously leveraging Electron applications by executing teams.exe with the --no-sandbox parameter to bypass security controls and execute additional payloads. Internal monitoring tools flagged unusual process spawns, but initial alerts were dismissed as false positives.\n\nCredential access involved network sniffing using tools like SniffPass to collect credentials by intercepting unencrypted traffic, which was facilitated by the previously installed hardware tap. Command and control was established over mail protocols, with ComRAT using email attachments for communication. Exfiltration occurred via scheduled transfers, where PowerShell was executed with the -WindowStyle Hidden parameter to run scripts without displaying windows, and data was saved to an external hard drive connected to the infected system for physical medium exfiltration. Finally, defacement was performed by modifying browser homepage images to redirect users to phishing sites, though this was detected and reverted within hours by the IT team. Post-incident analysis revealed no data loss beyond simulated credentials, and the company's backup systems remained uncompromised.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by the fictional threat actor CURIUM, which leveraged social engineering, supply chain compromise, and physical access to infiltrate corporate networks, harvest credentials, and exfiltrate data. The activity includes reconnaissance, initial access via phishing, execution through modified dependencies, persistence via device registration, credential theft via network sniffing, command and control over email protocols, and data exfiltration with defacement. Blue teams should review network trust dependencies, monitor for unauthorized hardware, and scrutinize software dependencies for anomalies.",
