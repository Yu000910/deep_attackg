    "clean_text": "Storm-1811, a fictional advanced persistent threat group, has been observed conducting a simulated cyber campaign against corporate networks. The actors initiated reconnaissance by scanning client device configurations across the corporate environment using network mapping tools like nmap. Concurrently, they developed a custom credential harvesting module disguised as a legitimate system utility to enhance their attack capabilities. For initial access, Storm-1811 employed spearphishing voice calls, posing as IT support to prompt users into downloading and executing malicious scripts. Upon execution, the attack script malicious.ps1 automatically established persistence and maintained access to the victim's system. The adversary then used the Windows Command Shell (cmd.exe) to execute commands for further exploitation while abusing pubprn.vbs with a remote UNC path to deploy ransomware on the target system. In a credential theft phase, the malware invoked Set-ADUser to alter user object settings, facilitating plaintext password recovery from the domain controller through reversible encryption. Throughout the campaign, Gold Dragon, a component of the malware, checked running processes on the victim's machine for reconnaissance and evasion. Additionally, the spyware implemented RSA encryption for secure command and control (C2) message transmission, ensuring covert communication. Logs from the victim's firewall showed increased outbound traffic to suspicious IP addresses, though no actual data exfiltration occurred in this training scenario. The company, a mid-sized financial services firm, reported no operational impact, as this was part of a controlled exercise.",
