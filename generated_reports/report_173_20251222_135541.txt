On 2024-09-15, TechNova Solutions, a fictional company specializing in cloud-based analytics software, reported anomalous activity in their Azure environment, prompting an investigation by internal security teams. Initial logs showed unusual API calls from a compromised user account, which had been dormant for several months due to an employee departure. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify this account, though no specific techniques were tagged in the provided scenario. The attack began with the adversary exploiting weak password policies to gain unauthorized access to a cloud administrator account [T1078.004], enabling them to manipulate virtual machine instances via the cloud API. Subsequently, they delivered a malicious .docx file through a spear-phishing email, which leveraged Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) [T1559.002] to execute PowerShell scripts [T1059.001] for initial payload deployment. Once inside the network, the threat actor used Azure RunCommand [T1651] to execute lateral movement commands across the virtual network while simultaneously modifying the HKLM Run registry entry [T1547] to ensure their backdoor launched automatically on system startup. To harvest credentials, the malware dropped a malicious Password Filter DLL [T1556.002] that intercepted plain-text passwords, which were then archived using custom encryption algorithms [T1560] before exfiltration. For C2 communication, the backdoor employed setsockopt to modify socket options [T1205.002], enabling reception of hidden activation packets while evading network detection. Finally, the actor exfiltrated proprietary source code by writing it to a removable USB drive [T1052], as detected by endpoint logs showing unauthorized hardware access during off-hours. Additional noise includes routine system updates and unrelated firewall alerts that were investigated but deemed benign.
