    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with a realistic training scenario based on fictional threat actor activity. The campaign, dubbed 'ShadowWeaver', begins with the actors uploading malware to Dropbox and using compromised VPN domain accounts for initial access and lateral movement. System logs from the targeted network show unusual login attempts from IP addresses in Eastern Europe, though these were not flagged by the existing security monitoring tools. Once inside, the adversary employed Visual Basic scripts to execute malicious payloads that injected code into svchost.exe while simultaneously modifying registry keys for Component Object Model Hijacking to establish persistence. The actors then used Mimikatz to extract cached domain credentials from LSASS memory and tainted shared content by placing a malicious executable on network drives. To exfiltrate data, they archived files using open-source libraries like zlib, collected sensitive deployment procedures from Confluence repositories, and transferred the data to a compromised Google Cloud account via API calls. Throughout the campaign, they obscured command and control traffic by adding junk data to HTTP requests and employing non-standard Base64 encoding. Background checks on the affected organization revealed no prior incidents, but internal audits noted outdated patch management processes.",
