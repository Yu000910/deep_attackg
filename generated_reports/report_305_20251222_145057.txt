The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on the activities of the fictional threat actor 'Cobalt Phantom', which has been observed targeting financial organizations in the United States. The actor operates with the intent to steal financial data and intellectual property, using sophisticated techniques to evade detection. Initial investigation logs from a compromised network show unusual DNS queries to domains associated with software updates, but these were initially dismissed as benign traffic. The campaign begins with the actors conducting malvertising [T1583.008] by distributing fake advertisements for popular accounting software on compromised ad networks, while simultaneously employing SEO poisoning [T1608.006] to manipulate search engine results by embedding hidden keywords in white text on legitimate-looking financial news websites. Following this, the actors use spearphishing via service [T1566.003] by sending deceptive job advertisements via LinkedIn to target employees in finance departments, which led to the initial compromise. Once access was gained, the adversary utilized a command and scripting interpreter [T1059] through PowerShell to execute malicious COM scriptlets that downloaded additional payloads, while establishing bidirectional communication [T1102.002] via VBScript that leveraged Google Apps Script services for command and control. System logs from the affected environment recorded multiple failed login attempts from unknown IP addresses, but these were not correlated with the ongoing attack. Finally, the actors performed exfiltration over other network medium [T1011] by connecting to an open WiFi network to transmit encrypted financial data to a remote server, completing the data theft phase of the attack.
