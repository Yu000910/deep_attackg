COATHANGER, a sophisticated threat actor, initiated this campaign by compromising a widely used development build tool, injecting a hidden cryptocurrency miner into software builds distributed to multiple organizations [T1195]. To facilitate credential theft, the actors established a serverless redirect service using AWS Lambda, which captured and forwarded stolen credentials to external servers [T1584.007]. Upon initial access, the malware exploited an unquoted path vulnerability by placing a malicious executable at C:\program.exe, allowing it to hijack legitimate program execution paths on Windows systems [T1574.009]. For persistence and reconnaissance, the actors modified the PowerShell profile (profile.ps1) to automatically run commands that gathered system information and network data each time PowerShell was launched [T1546.013], while also querying SharePoint repositories to harvest organizational charts and reporting structures for targeting purposes [T1213.002]. In virtualized environments, COATHANGER utilized the vSphere Web Services SDK to execute arbitrary commands on compromised guest virtual machines [T1675] and deployed a compromised vSphere Installation Bundle (VIB) to the hypervisor, ensuring persistent command and control connectivity [T1505.006]. For communication, the backdoor employed ICMP to transmit configuration data to and from its command and control servers [T1095] and encrypted collected system information using RC4, exfiltrating it over symmetric encrypted non-C2 protocols to avoid detection [T1048.001]. Throughout the campaign, the trojan secretly installed mining software that hijacked system resources to generate cryptocurrency revenue, impacting performance and operational efficiency [T1496]. During the investigation, analysts observed routine system logs showing normal user activity, such as scheduled backups and software updates, which were unrelated to the malicious activities. The targeted organization, a mid-sized fintech company with operations in North America and Europe, reported no prior significant security incidents, but this campaign highlighted vulnerabilities in their supply chain and virtualization management.
