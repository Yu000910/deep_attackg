CRIMSON_SKY actors likely conducted reconnaissance by executing systeminfo.exe to gather detailed firmware version and BIOS information from the compromised host [T1592.003] while simultaneously purchasing a custom ransomware builder from an underground forum to obtain capabilities [T1588] and searching exploit databases for working exploits targeting recently disclosed VMware vulnerabilities [T1588.005]. The initial access phase involved sending phishing messages posing as Microsoft Teams notifications to compromise corporate social media account credentials [T1586.001], followed by execution where malicious code was injected into update.ps1 to steal credentials from the target system [T1195.001]. The actors then utilized the vSphere Web Services SDK to execute arbitrary commands on compromised guest VMs [T1675] and imported cookie files from the victim's browser profile to hijack authenticated web sessions [T1550.004]. For persistence and command and control, they installed TinyPilot alongside legitimate remote access tools for redundancy [T1219.003]. In the exfiltration phase, the ransomware saved encryption keys to pastebin.com for later retrieval by the attackers [T1567.003]. System logs from the victim environment showed routine network traffic spikes unrelated to the intrusion, and the company, a mid-sized financial services firm, reported no prior incidents in the last quarter. Additional noise included false positives from antivirus scans detecting benign PowerShell scripts.
