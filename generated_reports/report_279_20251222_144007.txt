APT-CS actors likely conducted reconnaissance to identify financial sector employees, then established untraceable command and control (C2) infrastructure by provisioning virtual private servers on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure using cryptocurrency payments [T1584.003] and hijacking Route53 to modify NS records, redirecting entire domain resolution to attacker-controlled nameservers for operational security [T1584.001]. The initial access phase involved spearphishing via service, where the attacker created fake customer support accounts on Twitter to send malicious links to users reporting technical issues [T1566.003]. Upon execution, the adversary abused the ShellBrowserWindow Component Object Model (COM) object to execute arbitrary code via Internet Explorer automation [T1559.001], while a malicious Azure Runbook executed PowerShell commands to disable security controls using 'Set-MpPreference' via cloud API [T1059.009]. For persistence, the threat actor hijacked HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{87654321-4321-4321-4321-210987654321}\InprocServer32 with a malicious DLL through COM hijacking [T1546.015] and created ~/.config/autostart/system-utility.desktop with hidden malicious commands using XDG autostart entries [T1547.013]. System logs from the affected environment show routine maintenance activities, but no anomalies were flagged initially. To weaken defenses, attackers altered the access point's CLI settings to reduce the encryption key length from 256-bit to 64-bit, reducing the key space [T1600.001], and injected malicious code into the LSASS process memory to modify the authentication process and extract credentials [T1556]. The company, a mid-sized bank with operations in North America, reported unusual network traffic patterns during off-hours. For exfiltration, the threat actor used JamPlus.exe to process malicious.jam scripts that exfiltrated sensitive documents [T1127.003], embedded commands in image files via steganography for covert communication [T1001.002], and stored stolen credentials in a gist via the GitHub API endpoint https://api.github.com, exfiltrating data to a code repository [T1567.001].
