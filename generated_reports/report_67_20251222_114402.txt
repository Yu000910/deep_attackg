APT-99 likely conducts reconnaissance by scanning for open Wi-Fi networks named 'FreeWiFi' to gain initial access [T1669], then exploits cloud management APIs to establish persistent access to container registries [T1078.004]. Upon execution, the adversary employs a Hypervisor CLI [T1059.012] to snapshot virtual machines for data exfiltration while simultaneously writing a malicious VBScript to the user's startup directory for automatic execution via a login hook [T1037.002]. For persistence, they create a udev rule in /etc/udev/rules.d/99-persistence.rules to trigger on device removal [T1546.017] and hide malicious windows using ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden [T1564.003]. The malware uses reflective code loading [T1620] to run embedded code without disk writes and queries services with 'sc queryex type= service' to exploit file permissions weaknesses [T1574.010]. For credential access, the attacker searches /home directories for configuration files containing credentials [T1552.001] and extracts passwords from application stores [T1555]. Discovery activities include using GCP Command Center to identify storage buckets with weak controls [T1538], checking C2 connectivity via ping to 8.8.8.8 [T1016.001], and gathering domain trust information [T1482]. Command and control is established using steganography to conceal communications in image files [T1001.002] and bidirectional communication via Google Drive [T1102.002]. Exfiltration occurs over unencrypted protocols like HTTP POST [T1048.003], and the adversary modifies application.exe to display false system information through runtime data manipulation [T1565.003]. System logs from the fictional company 'CloudTech Solutions' show normal traffic patterns, but anomalous API calls were detected in their AWS environment, unrelated to the attack chain.
