    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with a realistic training scenario based on fictional APT activity. The campaign, dubbed 'Silent Tempest', targeted Precision Manufacturing Inc., a company specializing in aerospace components with annual revenue of $50 million and 200 employees. The threat actors likely conducted reconnaissance by extracting supplier information from the victim's 'Vendors' section on their official website and utilized passive DNS feeds to correlate domain activity and identify related infrastructure. During Operation Dust Storm, the threat actors sent spearphishing emails containing a malicious link to key personnel, which led to the exploitation of vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-10271 and CVE-2018-2894 to execute malicious scripts. System logs from the victim's environment showed increased network traffic on port 443 during off-peak hours, unrelated to the attack. The adversary employed an ARP spoofing tool obtained from GitHub to intercept network communications, then used Mimikatz's sekurlsa module to dump LSA secrets while simultaneously hooking the LogonUserExW API to capture domain credentials during login attempts. Silent Librarian has exfiltrated entire mailboxes from compromised accounts, and sensitive files were compressed into RAR format using the rarfile module for efficient data exfiltration. Network traffic was obfuscated through base64 -d encoding to avoid detection by security tools, and the attacker wrote a PowerShell script named 'malicious.ps1' to schedule data exfiltration during off-peak hours. Precision Manufacturing Inc.'s internal investigation noted no prior security incidents in the last quarter, but this campaign highlights the need for enhanced monitoring of supply chain relationships.",
