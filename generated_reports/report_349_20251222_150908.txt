The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign observed in simulated environments. The actors, designated as 'HomeLand Justice', likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify vulnerable systems. In the initial access phase, they exploited a default administrator account [T1078.001] to gain entry into the network via RDP, as observed in previous simulated incidents. During execution, the actors deployed a compromised website displaying a fraudulent 'Java Runtime Update Needed' notification, which downloaded and executed malware when users clicked 'Install' [T1204.004]. System logs from the affected host show unusual PowerShell activity at 2024-10-01 14:30:00 UTC, but this is unrelated to the primary attack vector. For persistence, the adversary modified cloud permissions to include administrative privileges [T1098.003] and used Cobalt Strike to make and impersonate tokens from known credentials [T1134.003], allowing them to move laterally across the network. Additionally, the malware author wrote a custom C2 client that splits data into multiple HTTP POST requests [T1001.001] to evade detection. The company, a fictional financial services firm with offices in New York and London, reported no actual data loss, but the simulation highlighted gaps in monitoring default accounts and user awareness training. Further analysis of network traffic revealed benign DNS queries to public servers, which are not indicative of malicious activity.
