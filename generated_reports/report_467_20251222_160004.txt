APT-FICT likely conducted initial reconnaissance by scanning the target's network using Nmap to identify active hosts and gather client configuration details [T1592.004], which revealed an unsecured kubelet instance. The actors then exploited this external remote service [T1133] to gain initial access to the victim environment, where they deployed a malicious container using Peirates to mount the node's root file system and establish a reverse shell [T1610]. Following this, they executed a forced authentication attack via a file://remote_address/Normal.dotm exploit that triggered a PowerShell script to harvest LSASS memory for credential hashes [T1187], while simultaneously deploying njRAT to capture keystrokes from compromised systems [T1056.001]. For command and control, APT-FICT employed asymmetric cryptography by encrypting Attor's Blowfish key with a public RSA key to secure communications [T1573.002]. During the investigation, system logs showed routine backup processes and unrelated user login attempts from internal IP addresses, which were not indicative of malicious activity. The target organization, a mid-sized tech firm with hybrid cloud infrastructure, reported no prior incidents but had outdated security policies for container management.
