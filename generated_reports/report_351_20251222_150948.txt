The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training insights into a fictional APT campaign. Crimson Shadow actors likely conducted reconnaissance by calling employees posing as a vendor to collect voice samples for voiceprint analysis [T1598.004]. The campaign then used WhatsApp to send malicious links in group chats disguised as COVID-19 relief information [T1566.003], leading to initial compromise. Once access was gained, the threat actor abused Azure Cloud Shell to run PowerShell commands that established persistence through scheduled tasks [T1059.009] while simultaneously modifying operating_system_image.bin to embed a backdoor password for system access [T1556.004]. Through SSH exploitation, the adversary maintained persistent remote control over the enterprise network devices [T1021.004] and proxied traffic through multiple infected systems [T1090.001] to obscure their activities. Logs from the affected systems showed unusual spikes in network traffic at 03:00 UTC, coinciding with scheduled maintenance windows, though no actual data loss occurred in this training scenario. The organization, a mid-sized regional hospital with outdated firewall policies, reported no operational impact during the exercise, but the simulation highlighted vulnerabilities in multi-factor authentication and cloud security configurations.
