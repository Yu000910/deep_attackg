    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams about the fictional threat actor 'ShadowLink', which has been observed targeting energy and telecommunications sectors since early 2024. Based on simulated intelligence, this campaign employs sophisticated techniques to compromise networks and exfiltrate sensitive data. Initial reconnaissance involved actors conducting searches for network topology and utilizing closed-source intelligence platforms to gather detailed infrastructure diagrams, while also scraping victim corporate websites to identify key business partners for potential supply chain attacks. In the initial access phase, the actors spoofed digital certificates to appear as legitimate Microsoft entities and launched spearphishing campaigns via the mailing service Constant Contact, distributing malicious .docx files that exploited Dynamic Data Exchange to execute remote commands. Upon execution, the malware established persistence by modifying registry keys and employed PowerShell scripts to download additional payloads. System logs from victim networks show anomalous RDP connections during off-hours, though these were initially attributed to maintenance activities. For lateral movement, the actors used pass the hash techniques to authenticate across domains and hijacked remote desktop sessions by intercepting RDP tokens, allowing unauthorized access to critical servers. Command and control was maintained through DNS requests over UDP port 53, blending with normal traffic, while exfiltration of stolen credentials was achieved over Bluetooth protocols to nearby devices. Post-compromise, the actors deployed tools capable of launching network denial of service attacks across multiple protocols, disrupting operations as a diversion or final stage. Background checks on the fictional actor suggest ties to previous campaigns, but no real-world attribution is implied. Blue teams should monitor for these indicators and apply patches to vulnerable services.",
