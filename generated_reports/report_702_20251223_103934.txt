On October 15, 2023, a critical infrastructure organization reported anomalous network traffic and performance degradation in their server environment. Background investigation revealed that the organization had recently updated software dependencies, including a popular open-source networking tool. Initial logs from the server room indicated intermittent packet loss and unusual SSL/TLS handshake patterns, with system administrators noting increased CPU usage on core application servers. The organization, a mid-sized energy provider in the Midwest, operates a hybrid cloud infrastructure with legacy on-premises systems.

The attack began with a supply chain compromise [T1195], where a trojanized version of the open-source package was distributed through the official repository, allowing the adversary to gain initial access. Concurrently, hardware additions [T1200] were discovered, as network administrators identified a passive tap on the server room's Ethernet line, facilitating data exfiltration. Once inside, the actors exploited an XPC service daemon's weak authentication [T1559.003] to gain elevated system access, then employed obfuscated Visual Basic macros [T1059.005] to execute malicious payloads while embedding junk data in Base64 strings [T1001.001] for additional obfuscation. The payload included a keylogging module [T1056.001] to capture sensitive credentials, and malicious scripts were used to initiate repeated SSL/TLS renegotiations [T1499.002], causing service exhaustion floods that degraded server availability. Post-incident analysis showed no evidence of lateral movement beyond the initial compromised systems, but logs indicated attempts to modify firewall rules, which were blocked by existing security controls.
