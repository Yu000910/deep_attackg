The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training insights into a fictional APT campaign, 'ShadowStride'. This campaign targets organizations in the energy and healthcare sectors, with initial activity detected in early 2024. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance by scanning IP blocks [T1595.001] to map internal network structures, followed by exploiting a known vulnerability in a public-facing Citrix NetScaler application [T1190] for initial access. Upon gaining entry, the adversary employed shared modules [T1129] to load malicious DLLs while simultaneously using input injection via a simulated HID USB device [T1674] to execute commands and establish persistence by modifying print processors [T1547.012]. The malware then implemented traffic signaling [T1205] to await specific TCP connections, and the threat actor exploited remote services [T1210] to compromise Windows Active Directory servers. To ensure deep persistence, a bootkit was deployed to overwrite the Master Boot Record [T1542.003], and data was collected from removable media [T1025] for exfiltration planning. Multi-stage channels [T1104] were utilized to gather host configuration data, and exfiltration over other network mediums [T1011] was conducted via a secondary cellular connection to avoid detection on corporate networks. System logs from the victim environment showed routine backup processes running at 02:00 UTC, with no immediate alerts triggered during the initial phases. The company, a mid-sized utility provider with operations across three states, reported no operational disruptions, but internal audits later identified anomalous network traffic patterns. Defensive recommendations include patching known vulnerabilities, monitoring for unusual USB device activity, and implementing network segmentation to limit lateral movement.
