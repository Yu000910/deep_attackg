On October 15, 2023, APT-99 initiated a campaign against Acme Corp, a technology firm with 5,000 employees. The actors first conducted reconnaissance by searching open websites and domains [T1593], specifically using Facebook to identify recent hires, and then created fake social media accounts [T1585.001] with AI-generated profile pictures to gather victim information through tailored spearphishing emails [T1598]. Acme's security logs showed normal network traffic during this phase, with no alerts triggered. Subsequently, APT-99 gained initial access by planting a USB Rubber Ducky disguised as a standard flash drive in the company breakroom [T1200], which an employee inadvertently connected to their workstation. Once executed, the malware established persistence by creating scheduled tasks [T1053.005] and applying application shims via a custom.sdb file [T1546.011] to disable security features while simultaneously writing a custom Outlook form to the organizational forms library [T1137.003]. The adversary then leveraged the compromised development environment to establish a persistent connection through IDE tunneling [T1219.001] and used Azure's native backup service to transfer critical file share data to a controlled cloud account [T1537]. Throughout the incident, Acme's IT team noted unrelated system logs, such as routine software updates and user login attempts from authorized locations, which did not correlate with the attack.
