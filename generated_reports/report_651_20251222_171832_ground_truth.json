    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional APT campaign designed for educational purposes. Crimson Shadow actors likely conduct reconnaissance by creating multiple temporary email accounts through Guerrilla Mail for disposable communications and using compromised credentials to log on to other systems. Initial access was achieved via exploitation of remote services, where the threat actor used nmap with SMB-specific scripts to enumerate shares and users on target machines. Upon gaining access, the actors executed commands through the Azure Serial Console to manipulate an Azure VM via the Azure portal interface while simultaneously altering Docker socket permissions to allow container execution by unprivileged users. For persistence, they dropped a suspicious DLL named 'printmon.dll' into the spool drivers directory and configured scheduled transfers, where Kazuar malware can sleep for specific times and be set to communicate at intervals. Exfiltration involved using Telnet to execute 'show running-config' and exfiltrate the network device's current configuration, followed by one-way communication where a PowerShell command was executed to delete event logs and cover tracks on the system. System logs from the affected environment show routine network traffic spikes at 02:00 UTC, unrelated to the attack, and the company background includes a recent merger with a logistics firm, which is not part of the threat activity.",

The campaign leverages compromised credentials, cloud exploitation, and network device manipulation to establish persistence and exfiltrate data. Blue teams should use this report for training to identify and mitigate similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).",
