    "clean_text": "On October 15, 2023, a mid-sized bank, 'SecureTrust Financial', reported anomalous network activity after an employee received a suspicious email. The bank's SOC team initiated an investigation, revealing a multi-stage attack. Background: SecureTrust Financial, established in 1998, operates across five states with 500 employees and uses a hybrid cloud infrastructure. Initial logs showed increased outbound traffic on port 4444, but no immediate alerts were triggered by their legacy antivirus. The attack began with the adversary sending a spearphishing email that appeared to originate from a trusted vendor, containing an attachment named 'Invoice_Report.DOC.exe' which used a double file extension to disguise itself as a document. Upon execution, the malware leveraged the ShellBrowserWindow COM object to load and run a malicious payload in memory, bypassing traditional file-based detection. Once established, the actor conducted discovery activities, using commands like 'net use' to enumerate network shares and connections while simultaneously checking for the presence of Kaspersky antivirus software to assess security defenses. The malware then implemented a web portal capture mechanism, redirecting login attempts to a controlled site to harvest credentials as users updated their passwords. Collected data, including browser cookies and network configurations, was staged in a temporary directory using bash scripts before being encrypted with AES-256 using a hardcoded key for archiving. For exfiltration, the actor embedded the encrypted data into benign-looking XML files using steganography to avoid detection and transmitted it over non-standard ports such as 4444 and 7900 to establish command and control channels. Incident response teams noted that system performance logs showed a 15% CPU spike during peak activity, but no further unauthorized access was detected after containment measures were applied.",
