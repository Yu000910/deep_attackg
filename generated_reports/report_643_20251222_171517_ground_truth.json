    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a simulated advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign dubbed 'ShadowHook'. This fictional scenario is based on observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) targeting financial organizations, with no real-world incidents reported. Background: The campaign is attributed to a fictional group mimicking known APT behaviors, focusing on data exfiltration and disruption. System logs from a simulated environment show unusual PowerShell activity and network anomalies starting in early 2024, but these are training artifacts. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance to identify targets. In the initial access phase, the adversary exploited a vulnerable Microsoft Exchange server to gain entry into the network, while simultaneously using a PowerShell script named phishing.ps1 to harvest email account credentials from compromised users. Upon execution, the malware hijacked legitimate COM objects to load and execute malicious code in memory, evading detection by leveraging application shim databases for persistence. For further persistence, the attacker employed the trap command to run a backdoor script upon receiving SIGTERM signals, ensuring continued access. In credential access, an automated tool performed password guessing attacks against exposed Telnet ports using previously breached credentials, attempting lateral movement. Command and control was established through an encrypted channel using a custom algorithm for communication, with instructions retrieved via a dead drop resolver that wrote encoded C2 data to dead_drop_resolver.txt hosted on a public GitHub repository. In the impact phase, the actor executed data destruction by overwriting and deleting critical files to disrupt operations. Additional logs show benign system updates and user login failures unrelated to the attack, included for realism in training scenarios.",
