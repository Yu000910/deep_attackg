The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide insights into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the fictional APT group 'SilentCloud'. This report is based on a simulated attack scenario designed for blue team training, incorporating realistic but fictionalized elements to enhance defensive preparedness.

**Attack Narrative:**
The campaign began with the threat actor compromising a DNS server [T1584] to manipulate domain resolutions, facilitating command and control (C2) communications. Simultaneously, they deployed a malicious script using Cloudflare Workers [T1584.007] to hide C2 traffic, blending it with legitimate serverless activity. System logs from the targeted organization, 'TechGlobal Inc.', showed anomalous DNS queries to previously unknown domains, though initial alerts were dismissed as false positives due to high network noise.

For initial access, the actor planted a USB Rubber Ducky disguised as a standard flash drive in the company breakroom [T1200], which, when inserted by an unsuspecting employee, executed a payload. This payload exploited Component Object Model interfaces [T1559] to run malicious code without writing to disk, while also checking for application windows via execution of `EnumWindows` [T1010] to avoid detection by security tools. Background checks revealed that TechGlobal Inc. had recently expanded its cloud footprint, but security audits lagged, creating vulnerabilities.

The actor then staged capabilities by uploading a PowerShell backdoor script to a private GitHub repository [T1608] for later retrieval. Using PowerShell, they actively downloaded this backdoor [T1059.001/T1105] while modifying registry keys [T1112] to establish persistence. The backdoor modified the LSASS process to load a custom driver [T1547.008] for continuous operation, and it employed libpcap libraries [T1205] to capture network packets and identify unused ports for covert communication. Network traffic analysis indicated sporadic spikes in encrypted traffic on non-standard ports, but these were initially attributed to backup processes.

Once established, the actor conducted discovery activities, including checking for Kubernetes node permissions [T1069] and using Connect-AZAccount [T1021.007] to gain access to Azure virtual machines and storage. They also listened for ARP requests [T1557.002] to discover active hosts on the local network. Data exfiltration involved copying files from USB devices to a predefined directory [T1025], compressing exfiltrated database dumps with strong AES encryption using libzip [T1560.002], and transferring them via encrypted email archives [T1048.001] or over C2 channels like SMTP and DNS [T1041]. To obscure their activities, they used Tor for multi-hop proxy C2 communication [T1090.003]. Incident response teams noted that exfiltrated data included sensitive customer records, but attribution was challenging due to the use of encrypted protocols and compromised infrastructure.

**Mitigation Recommendations:**
Blue teams should monitor for unusual DNS activity, restrict USB device usage, implement application allowlisting, and enhance logging for cloud service access. Regular security training for employees on physical threats is also advised. This fictional scenario underscores the importance of a layered defense strategy in hybrid environments.
