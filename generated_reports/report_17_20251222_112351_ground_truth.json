    "clean_text": "On October 15, 2023, a financial institution reported suspicious activity involving employee targeting. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by monitoring social media platforms such as LinkedIn to identify key employees, followed by spearphishing voice calls to instruct victims to visit credential-harvesting websites. Upon compromise, the adversary employed malicious attachments to deploy a remote access tool, which then exploited an XPC Service daemon vulnerability to escalate privileges from user to administrative levels. For persistence, the tool leveraged Outlook add-ins to maintain access, while using pass-the-hash techniques with pth.exe to move laterally and access the domain controller. System logs from the domain controller showed unusual FTP connections at 03:00 UTC, unrelated to scheduled backups. The C2 communications utilized file transfer protocols with data obfuscation by embedding responses in fake webpage source code, and exfiltrated sensitive data over the C2 channel to external servers. The company, a mid-sized bank with operations in North America, reported no financial loss but initiated an internal investigation.",
