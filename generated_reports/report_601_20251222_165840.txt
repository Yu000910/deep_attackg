The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on fictional APT activity attributed to 'PittyTiger'. This campaign targets organizations leveraging cloud services and Docker containers, with initial access often gained through compromised valid accounts. On 2023-10-15, system logs from a victim organization showed unusual port scans originating from IP 192.0.2.100, which was later linked to PittyTiger infrastructure. The actor likely conducted reconnaissance by scanning victim IP addresses [T1590.005] to identify open ports and services, while simultaneously querying DNS servers [T1596.001] to map mail exchange records for the target domain 'examplecorp.com'. Additionally, malware deployed in earlier phases automatically collected employee names [T1589.003] from public staff biographies to craft targeted phishing emails. PittyTiger attempts to obtain legitimate credentials during operations [T1078], often using tools like Empire with Inveigh to conduct LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning [T1557.001] for credential theft and relay attacks. Once initial access was achieved, the attacker used 'docker exec -it container_name /bin/bash' [T1609] to gain shell access to a running container, then employed RDP hijacking [T1563] to move laterally to a domain controller. To maintain persistence and evade detection, the malware performed DNS queries to 'tunnel.data.com' [T1568] for covert command and control, and attackers leveraged raw sockets [T1205] to craft custom TCP packets that bypassed standard firewall rules. For exfiltration, BITSAdmin was used to create BITS Jobs [T1048.003] to upload files from compromised hosts over unencrypted protocols, while the attacker also utilized the Azure Storage REST API [T1537] to transfer sensitive files to a compromised cloud storage account. Network monitoring at the victim site recorded increased traffic to external IPs during these activities, but no alerts were triggered due to misconfigured SIEM rules.
