The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform network defenders about a fictional APT campaign observed in training scenarios. Actors likely conduct reconnaissance by searching Instagram for posts tagged with the company's location to map employee movements [T1591] and performing searches on domain analysis websites to gather information about the victim's web infrastructure [T1596.003]. Malicious software then performed DNS lookups to resolve internal hostnames and IP addresses for targeting [T1590]. The threat actor created a fake certificate.pem file in /var/www/ssl/ to impersonate a legitimate website [T1608.003], while malware was configured to automatically connect to any open Wi-Fi access point named 'FreeWiFi' [T1669]. The adversary called claiming to be from Microsoft support and directed the user to install AnyDesk [T1566.004]. Gomir reads command line arguments and parses them for functionality when executed from a Linux shell, and can execute arbitrary strings passed to it as shell commands [T1059.004]. The infection modified HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment to force .NET processes to load a malicious library [T1574.012]. Okrum can establish persistence by adding a new service NtmsSvc with the display name Removable Storage to masquerade as a legitimate Removable Storage Manager [T1036.004]. A fake authentication DLL was written to replace the legitimate system authentication module [T1556.002]. REvil can identify the domain membership of a compromised host [T1069.002]. Pandora can identify if incoming HTTP traffic contains a token and if so it will intercept the traffic and process the received command [T1205]. System logs from the victim environment showed routine backup processes running at 02:00 UTC, unrelated to the attack. The company, a mid-sized financial services firm, reported no operational disruptions during this simulated incident, but blue teams should monitor for similar patterns in real-world scenarios.
