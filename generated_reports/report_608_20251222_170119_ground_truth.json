    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams about a fictional APT campaign designated 'ShadowLink,' which targets financial organizations through a multi-phase attack. In the initial reconnaissance phase, the actors conducted passive DNS analysis by querying public resolvers like 8.8.8.8 to map target infrastructure, while simultaneously compromising a third-party file-sharing service to host malicious payloads for distribution. Subsequently, they executed a supply chain attack by tampering with a development linker tool to embed covert persistence mechanisms into legitimate software builds, enabling initial access. Upon deployment, the adversary used a simulated HID USB device to inject keystrokes for command execution, and they elevated privileges by setting the setuid flag on a binary to gain root access. For lateral movement, they leveraged AWS Systems Manager to disable firewalls across EC2 instances, and they employed port knocking techniques by sniffing network traffic with libpcap to identify open ports for stealthy communication. During exfiltration, the backdoor wrote stolen credentials to a USB flash drive, and a network sniffer captured and manipulated unencrypted database queries containing customer PII for data theft. System logs from the target environment showed routine authentication events and network traffic spikes, but these were unrelated to the attack. The financial institution involved, 'SecureBank Inc.,' reported no actual breaches, as this scenario is purely educational for training purposes.",
