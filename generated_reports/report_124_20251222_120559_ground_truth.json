    "clean_text": "APT-EDU-01, a simulated advanced persistent threat group, has been observed targeting financial institutions in a fictional campaign designed for educational purposes. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance on target networks to identify vulnerabilities in physical security and software configurations. In one incident, a passive network tap was surreptitiously installed in a server room, allowing the adversary to intercept unencrypted credentials from network traffic. Concurrently, they modified a Dockerfile in a development environment to download and execute ransomware upon container startup, leveraging misconfigured access controls. After gaining initial footholds, APT-EDU-01 manipulated domain accounts by granting excessive privileges and resetting passwords for default admin accounts while elevating newly created local accounts to the administration group. To harvest additional credentials, the actors searched bash_history files for stored passwords and used memory dumping tools to extract credentials from the LastPass browser extension. For lateral movement, they exploited the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) interface to remotely execute payloads via Microsoft Office inter-process communication and employed remote access tools, such as a VNC module downloaded from command and control (C2) servers. System logs from affected servers show increased network traffic and unauthorized process executions, though some entries were benign routine maintenance activities. The company background includes a mid-sized bank with hybrid cloud infrastructure, but no actual financial losses occurred in this training scenario. Response teams should monitor for unusual hardware additions, anomalous container behavior, and credential access patterns.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a fictional campaign by a simulated threat actor, designated APT-EDU-01, targeting organizations in the financial sector. Based on training scenarios, APT-EDU-01 employs a multi-faceted approach involving hardware-based network interception, malicious containerization, and credential harvesting to facilitate ransomware deployment and persistent access. The campaign exploits unencrypted network traffic, misconfigured DevOps environments, and weak credential management practices. This report is intended for blue team training to enhance detection and response capabilities against such tactics.",
