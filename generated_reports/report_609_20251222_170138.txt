On October 15, 2023, multiple financial institutions reported anomalous network activity traced to a sophisticated intrusion campaign. The threat actors, designated as APT-Fictitious, likely began with reconnaissance on employee roles via LinkedIn and corporate websites, though no specific technique tags apply to this general activity. Initial access was achieved through spearphishing emails [T1566.001] that contained malicious Excel attachments with embedded macros, which, when enabled, executed a PowerShell script to download a custom webshell [T1587.001] from a compromised web service [T1102] such as OneDrive. Upon execution, the actors employed the webshell to establish persistence by creating an XPC service [T1559.003] that modified registry keys to bypass User Account Control [T1548.002] and installed an Emond rule [T1546.014] by writing a plist file to /etc/emond.d/rules/, ensuring long-term access. In the cloud environment, the actors leveraged compromised Azure Managed Identities [T1078.004] to escalate privileges and access virtual machines, where they used AWS CLI to transfer exfiltrated financial data [T1537] to an S3 bucket under their control. To inhibit recovery efforts, the actors executed vssadmin.exe to delete shadow copies [T1490], attempting to remove backup files and hinder system restoration. Logs from affected systems showed increased network traffic to external IP addresses, but these entries were not tagged as they represent normal monitoring noise. The campaign's impact included data theft and operational disruption, with remediation involving isolating compromised accounts and applying security patches.
