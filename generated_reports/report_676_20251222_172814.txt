### Executive Summary
On [Fictional Date], multiple financial organizations reported suspicious network activities, leading to the discovery of the 'ShadowMimic' campaign. This fictional scenario, created for educational purposes, involves a multi-stage attack leveraging social engineering, credential theft, and sophisticated evasion methods. The attack began with the adversary establishing a deceptive Facebook account impersonating a tech support representative to initiate contact with employees [T1585]. Concurrently, they acquired compromised administrator credentials from an access broker network to gain unauthorized access [T1650]. Upon infiltration, security scans revealed that the Guest account was accessible with blank password credentials, which the actors exploited to move laterally within the network [T1078.001]. The threat actor then executed 'systemctl start backdoor.service' to activate a remote access tool [T1569.003] while using raw sockets to craft custom packets that concealed command and control channels [T1205]. To evade detection, malware executed regasm.exe to register a rogue COM component [T1218.009] and utilized encrypted binaries with base64 encoded strings for payload delivery [T1027.013]. Further persistence was achieved by modifying HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog settings to load a malicious DLL instead of the legitimate service [T1574.011]. The actors also changed Okta conditional access policies to weaken session timeout requirements using compromised credentials [T1556.009] and ran tscon.exe to hijack an established remote desktop connection [T1563.002]. For command and control, the malware dynamically registered a new DNS A record pointing to its C2 server [T1568.001] and injected C2 traffic into image files like file.jpg to bypass network detection mechanisms [T1001.002]. Logs from affected systems showed unusual spikes in network traffic and failed login attempts, but these were initially dismissed as routine anomalies. The organization's background includes a recent merger, leading to inconsistent security policies across departments, which may have contributed to the simulated breach. This report serves as a training tool to highlight the importance of monitoring for these techniques in real-world scenarios.
