The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the fictional APT group Crimson Hydra. This report is based on a simulated incident for training purposes and does not reflect real-world events. Crimson Hydra likely conducted reconnaissance by using online WHOIS services to identify creation dates of the organization's registered domains [T1596.002] and purchased employee directory information from dark web marketplaces to map key personnel [T1597.002]. Initial access was achieved through a supply chain compromise, where attackers substituted an authentic compiled release package on a download server with a malicious version containing ransomware components [T1195.002], and exploited CVE-2023-48022 on publicly exposed Ray servers to steal computing power and expose sensitive data [T1190]. Execution involved using Python for scripting to run additional commands [T1059.006] and employing a simulated HID USB device to inject keystrokes and execute commands on the target system [T1674]. Persistence and credential access were facilitated by a script that queried securityd to obtain keychain password entries [T1555.002]. Lateral movement and exfiltration included placing a malicious script on removable media as malware.exe to spread to air-gapped networks [T1091] and using the system's integrated camera to record video of the user's environment [T1125]. Command and control was maintained through PlugX using Pastebin to store C2 addresses [T1102.001]. System logs from the affected organization showed routine network traffic spikes unrelated to this activity, and background checks revealed no prior incidents involving this fictional group. The organization's IT department reported normal operations during the simulated timeframe, with no actual data loss occurring.
