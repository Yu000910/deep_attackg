The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide a fictional, educational overview of APT-42's activities for blue team training purposes. APT-42, a suspected state-sponsored group, has been observed targeting organizations using a multi-phase attack chain. Initial reconnaissance involved scanning the corporate network for systems with the default Guest account enabled [T1078.001]. Once access was gained, the actors employed Azure Run Command and Azure Admin-on-Behalf-of (AOBO) to execute malicious code on virtual machines [T1651], leveraging JavaScript launcher files [T1059.007] downloaded from a compromised web server. System logs from the affected VMs showed unusual process creation events around 02:00 UTC, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured monitoring tools. For persistence, the malware modified the AppCertDLLs registry entry to point to a malicious library stored in the Temp folder [T1546.009], while simultaneously staging host information locally as an encrypted RAR file at %TEMP%/TS_FB56.tmp [T1074.001]. The company, a mid-sized tech firm with operations in North America and Europe, reported intermittent network slowdowns during this phase. Data exfiltration was conducted using git to access and extract version control history containing sensitive database credentials [T1213.003], with C2 traffic encrypted and tunneled through legitimate web services via HTRAN [T1090.002] and using Twitter as a backup for one-way communication [T1102.003]. Additionally, the actors connected to a public WiFi network to send encryption keys to the command and control server [T1011], bypassing corporate firewall rules. Post-exfiltration, APT-42 manipulated stored data by altering the path information of deleted files to hinder recovery efforts [T1565.001], and executed a Python script to repeatedly send empty emails with large attachments, causing email bombing [T1667]. Internal IT teams noted a spike in email server load but initially attributed it to a marketing campaign. This campaign highlights the need for robust cloud security configurations and monitoring of non-standard network activities.
