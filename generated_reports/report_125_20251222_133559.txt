The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the fictional APT group 'Cobalt Shadow.' This group has been observed targeting software development companies since early 2024, with incidents reported across North America and Europe. Background analysis indicates the actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] through open-source intelligence gathering, though specific details are not confirmed in this scenario. The campaign begins with the adversary exploiting a trusted relationship [T1199] by using compromised Office 365 partner credentials to gain administrative control over a target tenant, which allowed them to access domain accounts [T1078.002] for authentication on internal networks. Once initial access was achieved, the actors deployed a malicious Visual Studio extension package [T1176.002] to create a persistent foothold, which then employed PowerShell to inject dynamic-link libraries [T1055.001] into processes based on installed security software, while simultaneously using input injection [T1674] to monitor Windows message queue events for keyboard logging. To escalate privileges, the group performed AS-REP roasting [T1558.004] by searching for Kerberos authentication data in memory dumps via PowerShell, and they leveraged distributed component object model [T1021.003] to execute code remotely through Microsoft PowerPoint's COM objects for lateral movement. Additionally, the actors utilized remote desktop software [T1219.002] such as a modified version of TeamViewer for maintaining remote access, and system logs from affected endpoints showed unusual network traffic patterns, though these were not directly linked to the attack techniques. The campaign demonstrates a multi-faceted approach to evading detection and maintaining persistence in development environments.
