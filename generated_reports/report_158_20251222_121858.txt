The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training insights into a fictional APT campaign designated 'ShadowLink'. This report is based on simulated threat intelligence and does not reflect real-world incidents. The actors likely began by conducting passive reconnaissance through DNS queries [T1596.001] to map subdomains and identify potential entry points, while simultaneously purchasing credentials and session tokens from underground forums [T1597.002] to facilitate initial access. Following this, they executed active scanning using tools like nmap.exe [T1595] to probe the victim's IP range for vulnerabilities and scanned for open Wi-Fi networks [T1669] to exploit weak wireless security. In the execution phase, the adversary employed a social engineering tactic by displaying a fake 'System Update Required' error message to trick users into copying and pasting malicious code [T1204.004], which led to payload deployment. Post-exploitation, the actors cleared select Windows event logs [T1070.001] and removed network share connections using commands like 'net use \\server\share /delete' [T1070.005] to obscure their activities. They further conducted discovery by running 'gpresult /z' to gather detailed Group Policy information [T1615]. For command and control, ShadowLink utilized publish/subscribe protocols such as Jabber/XMPP [T1071.005] to communicate with C2 servers, with traffic encrypted and encoded using Base64 [T1132.001] to evade detection. Additional system logs from the victim environment showed routine backup processes and unrelated firewall alerts, which were not indicative of malicious activity. The campaign's infrastructure included domains registered in the past six months, with no ties to known APT groups in real-world databases.
