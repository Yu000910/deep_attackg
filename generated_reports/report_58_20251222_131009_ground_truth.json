    "clean_text": "APT-FICT actors initiated their campaign by exploiting compromised valid accounts to gain initial access to the target network, leveraging stolen credentials from a previous breach. Upon entry, they employed Python scripts to execute malicious code that exfiltrated sensitive data while simultaneously using non-application layer protocols like ICMP for command and control communications to evade detection. To establish persistence, the actors created systemd timers on Linux systems, scheduling periodic execution of payloads. For lateral movement, they transferred tools via network shares and modified domain policies to weaken security settings across the tenant. During exfiltration, data was hidden using steganography in image files and transmitted over web services. System logs from the compromised domain controller showed unusual login attempts at 03:00 UTC, and network traffic analysis revealed spikes in ICMP packets, though some alerts were false positives from routine maintenance scripts. The company, a mid-sized financial services firm with offices in three countries, reported no immediate financial loss but noted increased help desk tickets for password resets during the incident period.",

The campaign involves credential theft, lateral movement, persistence mechanisms, and data exfiltration using sophisticated techniques. Blue teams are advised to review logs, implement multi-factor authentication, and monitor for anomalous network activity.",
