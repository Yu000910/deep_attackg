The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the fictional APT group CrimsonShadow in a recent simulated campaign. CrimsonShadow, believed to operate out of Eastern Europe, has historically targeted critical infrastructure, with this campaign focusing on mid-sized banks in the U.S. and Canada. Initial analysis suggests the group aims to exfiltrate sensitive financial data and deploy ransomware.

**Attack Narrative:**
CrimsonShadow likely began by conducting reconnaissance to gather victim identity information [T1589], such as employee email addresses and organizational roles, through open-source intelligence (OSINT) and social media scraping. System logs from a compromised bank, 'SecureBank Inc.', show unusual API calls to the GetUserRealm service, indicating the actors used domain properties [T1590.001] to determine the authentication type (managed vs. federated) for targeted user accounts. This reconnaissance phase lasted approximately two weeks, with no immediate malicious activity detected.

Following reconnaissance, the actors employed a multi-vector initial access approach. They likely sent phishing emails containing malicious macros that, when enabled by users, executed PowerShell commands to download additional payloads [T1204.004] and used content injection [T1659] to intercept and modify DNS queries via a compromised ISP channel, redirecting victims to malicious domains hosting credential-stealing pages. For example, on 2023-10-15, SecureBank's network logs recorded anomalous DNS requests to 'malicious-dns[.]com', which were later traced to this technique.

Upon gaining access, CrimsonShadow utilized the Windows Command Shell [T1059.003] to execute commands and deploy tools, such as downloading a backdoor via ingress tool transfer [T1105] to establish persistent communication channels. The actors then modified registry keys to enable AppInit DLLs [T1546.010] and deployed a password filter DLL [T1556.002] to capture credentials in real-time, while also performing system checks [T1497.001] to evade sandboxed environments and avoid detection. Additionally, they configured a VNC server [T1021.005] on a non-standard port (e.g., 5901) for remote desktop access, allowing continuous monitoring and control over compromised systems.

**Irrelevant Information:** SecureBank Inc., founded in 1995, operates 50 branches across the Midwest and reported $2 billion in assets last quarter. Their IT infrastructure includes a mix of Windows 10 and Server 2019 systems, with legacy applications running on outdated Java versions. During the incident, routine backup processes were unaffected, and customer data remained encrypted at rest. The bank's security team initially dismissed the anomalous logs as false positives from a recent software update, delaying response by 48 hours.

**Mitigation Recommendations:** Organizations should implement multi-factor authentication, monitor for unusual API and DNS activity, and restrict macro execution in email clients. Regular audits of registry settings and DLL files are advised to detect persistence mechanisms.
