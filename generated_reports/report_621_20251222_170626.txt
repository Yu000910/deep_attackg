On 2023-10-15, security teams at a fictional multinational corporation, 'TechGlobal Inc.', detected anomalous network traffic originating from a newly registered domain, 'linkedin-careers[.]com', which mimicked legitimate services to establish initial access [T1583.001]. Concurrently, an employee reported a USB drive found in the parking lot; forensic analysis revealed a malicious script that, when executed, dropped 'malware.exe' onto the system, enabling replication through removable media [T1091]. The actors then leveraged PowerShell [T1059] to download additional payloads [T1105] from command-and-control servers while modifying registry keys to persist across reboots. During lateral movement, the adversary used services.exe to execute a batch script that employed PsExec to deploy ransomware payloads across the network [T1569.002], and they utilized compromised Local Administrator accounts [T1078.003] to access internal systems. In one instance, they executed tscon.exe with a session ID parameter to hijack an active RDP session [T1563.002], while in another, they injected a credential-stealing DLL into browser sessions to steal authentication tokens [T1185]. The campaign further involved accessing Microsoft Dynamics 365 with stolen credentials to exfiltrate customer account details [T1213.004], and the actors employed content injection techniques [T1659] into DNS replies to redirect hosts to malicious download sites. System logs from TechGlobal's SIEM showed increased failed login attempts and unusual process creations, though some entries were benign user activity. As a diversion, the actors launched a network denial of service attack [T1498] against an internal web server, causing temporary service disruption but no data loss. The company's background includes operations in 30 countries with over 10,000 employees, focusing on cloud services and IoT devices, which provided a broad attack surface. This fictional scenario underscores the importance of monitoring for domain spoofing, removable media threats, and service abuse in defensive strategies.
