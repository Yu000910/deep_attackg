The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by APT-42 'ShadowHawk' in a fictional training scenario. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance by gathering employee names [T1589.003] from public sources such as LinkedIn and company websites, while simultaneously querying code repositories [T1593.003] like GitLab to identify hardcoded credentials in source code, which were used to gain initial insights into the target's infrastructure. On April 15, 2024, at 02:30 UTC, system logs from 'FinCorp Bank' detected unusual network traffic originating from an unauthorized Raspberry Pi device that was physically connected to an internal switch in the headquarters' server room [T1200], allowing the adversary to bypass perimeter defenses and establish a foothold within the local network. The actors then exploited a known Microsoft Office vulnerability, CVE-2017-11882, to execute malicious code on a compromised workstation [T1203], leveraging this access to deploy a payload that modified the registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NetworkProvider\Order to include a rogue network provider DLL [T1556.008] and injected a malicious DLL into the LSASS process memory to capture plaintext passwords [T1556.002], enabling credential theft and lateral movement. Additionally, the malicious tool employed fast flux DNS techniques [T1568.001] by de-registering DNS A records to obscure command-and-control infrastructure and hinder forensic analysis, as observed in network logs showing rapid IP changes for suspicious domains. Background noise: FinCorp Bank, a mid-sized financial institution with operations in North America, reported no actual data loss, but this scenario underscores the importance of physical security and regular code audits.
