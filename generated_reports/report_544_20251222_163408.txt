The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign designated 'ShadowHarbor'. This group targets financial organizations, with initial access often gained through phishing campaigns. Background: 'ShadowHarbor' is believed to operate from Eastern Europe, focusing on data theft for financial gain. System logs from a simulated victim, 'FinSecure Bank', show unusual login attempts from IP addresses in non-business hours, though these were not tagged as malicious. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify domain accounts. In the execution phase, they used Mimikatz.exe to extract Kerberos tickets from domain user sessions [T1078.002] and displayed a deceptive 'Document Conversion Failed - Click to Retry' dialog that executed encoded commands when the user retried the operation [T1204.004]. For persistence, Wizard Spider has established persistence using Userinit by adding the Registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon [T1547.004]. In defense evasion, Sakula calls cmd.exe to run various DLL files via rundll32 [T1218.011] while simultaneously conducting system checks to detect sandboxes or VMware services [T1497.001]. During lateral movement, Hildegard has used masscan to search for kubelets and the kubelet API for additional running containers [T1613]. For command and control, OSX_OCEANLOTUS.D has used a custom binary protocol over port 443 for C2 traffic [T1095]. Finally, Exbyte exfiltrates collected data to online file hosting sites such as 'Mega.co.nz' [T1567]. Additional logs show routine backup processes that were unrelated to the attack. Mitigation includes monitoring for unusual domain account activity and implementing application whitelisting.
