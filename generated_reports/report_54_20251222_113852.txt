Shadow Serpent, a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has been observed conducting a sophisticated campaign against organizations with mixed on-premises and cloud infrastructures. The group likely initiated reconnaissance through open-source intelligence gathering, though specific techniques are not detailed in this scenario. In the Initial Access phase, the actors exploited a compromised valid account [T1078] to gain entry into the victim's network, using it to schedule tasks for persistence. Once inside, they executed malicious activities by abusing a serverless Lambda function in the cloud environment [T1648] to run unauthorized shell commands, while simultaneously modifying the Security Support Provider (SSP) in the Windows registry at HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Security Packages [T1547.005] to install a custom authentication package for credential harvesting. To maintain stealth, the actors hid critical directories, such as VirtualBox and VBoxVmService, by setting their attributes to 'hidden' [T1564.001], and weakened encryption by altering a crypto hardware driver to intercept keys before they reached secure modules [T1600]. In the Persistence and Privilege Escalation phase, they modified file permissions using commands like 'chmod 666 /var/log/auth.log' [T1222] to allow unauthorized read/write access to authentication logs. For Defense Evasion, the group employed multi-factor authentication (MFA) request generation [T1621], continuously sending MFA push notifications to overwhelm victims until acceptance, and used stolen application access tokens [T1550.001] to query administrative REST APIs for elevated privileges. During Command and Control (C2), the actors leveraged publish/subscribe protocols [T1071.005], abusing XMPP's multi-user chat features for encrypted communications to coordinate activities. In the Exfiltration phase, data was transferred to cloud storage services like Dropbox [T1567.002] using encrypted channels. Finally, to disrupt operations, the group executed system shutdowns [T1529] via commands like `ExitWindowsEx` with the `EXW_SHUTDOWN` flag, causing reboots on compromised hosts. Throughout the campaign, system logs showed normal traffic patterns, and the organization's background in financial services provided no direct indicators; irrelevant network alerts included false positives from legacy systems, which were not tagged as part of the attack chain.
