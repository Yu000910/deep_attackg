Leviathan, a simulated advanced persistent threat (APT) group, conducted a multi-stage campaign against organizations using Azure and Outlook services. The actors initiated reconnaissance by scanning network segments with nmap to identify running services [T1590.004] and sent phishing emails to harvest client proxy settings and network configurations [T1592.004]. Subsequently, they distributed malicious emails via Outlook.com to deploy credential harvesting links [T1598.001] and used spearphishing with fraudulent lookalike domains and stolen branding to trick users into clicking malicious links [T1566.002]. After gaining initial access, Leviathan deployed malicious.exe on a compromised cloud hosting provider to conduct further reconnaissance [T1584] and employed AADInternals to execute commands on Azure virtual machines via the VM agent [T1651]. To maintain persistence and evade detection, the actors used IPsec Helper to delete registry keys related to execution [T1070] and leveraged ExchangePowerShell to clear email logs containing evidence of phishing campaigns [T1070.008]. For data exfiltration, they concealed ransomware payloads within ZIP files to bypass security tools [T1027.015] and encrypted collected data using AES CBC mode with Base64 encoding via SUGARDUMP [T1560.003]. Additionally, the 'ZJ' variant of BACKSPACE was utilized to relay internal proxy traffic to command servers [T1090.001], and botnet.exe was activated to coordinate direct network flooding attacks [T1498.001]. During the investigation, system logs from the affected Azure tenant showed anomalous login attempts from IP addresses in Eastern Europe, but these were later attributed to misconfigured firewall rules. The company, a mid-sized financial services firm, reported no actual data loss, as this was a controlled training exercise.
