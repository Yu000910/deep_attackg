    "clean_text": "On October 15, 2023, 'ShadowLink' actors initiated a campaign against a fictional technology firm, 'TechGlobal Inc.', by sending phishing emails with malicious links that required user interaction to execute macros, leading to initial infection. Upon execution, the malware conducted security software discovery to identify antivirus and endpoint detection agents, ensuring evasion before proceeding. The actors then employed PowerShell to download and execute 'host_info.ps1', which gathered system configuration data for command and control (C2) communication. To maintain persistence, the malware used schtasks.exe to schedule the execution of 'ransomware.exe' every Friday evening, while simultaneously exploiting stolen SSH private keys to authenticate to other systems in the network. For exfiltration, the malware connected to an unprotected wireless network, and in a related tactic, the actors deployed an Evil Twin access point in a public area near the target to passively monitor all wireless communications. System logs from TechGlobal Inc. showed increased network traffic on port 22, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured monitoring tools. The company, which specializes in cloud services, had recently expanded its remote workforce, potentially increasing attack surface. Additional irrelevant log entries included routine backup processes and user login attempts from authorized IP addresses, which did not correlate with the malicious activity.",
