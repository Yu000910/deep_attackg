    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign dubbed 'ShadowVendor.' This exercise simulates an attack on 'GlobalTech Industries,' a company specializing in industrial automation with annual revenue of $500 million and offices in New York and Tokyo. Initial reconnaissance involved extracting supplier details from the victim's 'Vendors' webpage while simultaneously establishing a fake professional networking profile to harvest corporate contacts. System logs from April 15, 2024, show no unusual activity during this phase, but subsequent scanning using nmap.exe for TCP SYN sweeps on the IP range 192.168.1.0/24 was detected. The actors then gained access via a compromised corporate VPN, exploiting weak authentication protocols, and used Windows Command Shell to execute a .bat script that downloaded a backdoor from a compromised GitHub repository, which installed a fraudulent SSL certificate at C:\\ProgramData\\cert.pem for man-in-the-middle operations. Persistence was maintained by executing 'code.exe' as an IDE extension, and the malware employed a Domain Generation Algorithm for command and control communications while using libpcap to sniff network traffic for port knocking. Credential theft involved configuring AWS Traffic Mirroring to capture unencrypted credentials and using Pass-the-Hash techniques to authenticate to the Windows domain controller. Finally, the botnet launched a network denial-of-service attack by sending millions of UDP packets to random firewall ports, though internal monitoring showed minimal disruption due to simulated defenses. This scenario is purely educational, with all data fabricated for blue team training purposes.",
