The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on the fictional threat actor group 'ShadowHarbor', which has been observed targeting critical infrastructure organizations in a simulated campaign for educational purposes. This report is based on a hypothetical scenario to enhance blue team readiness. ShadowHarbor, a state-sponsored group, likely initiated operations by conducting passive reconnaissance, querying multiple nameservers to enumerate DNS records for the target organization [T1596.001] and using tools to search jsdelivr.com for publicly accessible customer assets [T1596.004]. Following initial access via a spear-phishing email (not tagged in this scenario), the actors established persistence by creating local admin accounts on compromised hosts [T1078.003] and employed system services, using svchost.exe to execute a malicious DLL that encrypted user files [T1569]. Concurrently, the malware gained unauthorized access to webcam audio to monitor conversations [T1123] and utilized domain generation algorithms to send DNS command and control communications [T1568.002], while establishing a persistent cellular data link for continuous data exfiltration [T1011]. Incident responders noted increased network traffic from the compromised host at 10:15 AM EST, with logs showing multiple failed login attempts from an IP address in a non-operational region, though these were unrelated to the tagged techniques. The organization, a fictional energy provider based in the Midwest, reported no actual data loss, but this scenario highlights the need for robust monitoring of DNS anomalies and endpoint security.
