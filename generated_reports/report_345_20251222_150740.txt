On April 15, 2024, a fictional multinational corporation, TechGlobal Inc., reported anomalous activity in its Azure cloud environment, prompting an investigation. TechGlobal Inc., with operations in 30 countries and over 10,000 employees, primarily in the manufacturing sector, had recently migrated critical infrastructure to cloud platforms, including Microsoft Azure and AWS. Initial logs from their Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system showed unusual login attempts from unrecognized IP addresses, but these were initially dismissed as false positives due to high network traffic during a quarterly audit. The attack began with reconnaissance, where actors likely gathered employee information from public sources, though no specific techniques were tagged in this phase. The actors then conducted initial access by sending phishing messages posing as Microsoft Teams notifications to compromise corporate social media account credentials [T1586.001], which were used to gain entry into internal communication channels. Once inside, they executed malicious activities using Python scripts [T1059.006] to deploy a payload named malware.exe onto removable media [T1091], enabling lateral movement to air-gapped networks in isolated manufacturing units. For persistence and evasion, the actors utilized the Azure Serial Console feature to establish direct cloud VM connections [T1021.008], bypassing network security controls, while simultaneously employing GUI input capture via counterfeit iCloud authentication dialogs [T1056.002] to phish additional credentials from macOS users in the marketing department. Data exfiltration was achieved through clipboard data capture [T1115], logging stolen information to a predefined file, and protocol tunneling [T1572] to covertly transmit data out of the network. Finally, the actors engaged in resource hijacking [T1496] by configuring infected machines as SOCKS proxies for anonymous internet traffic, exploiting system resources for malicious purposes. Throughout the campaign, irrelevant background noise included routine system updates on April 10, 2024, that temporarily increased CPU usage by 15%, and a false alert from an outdated intrusion detection system on April 12, 2024, related to a legacy application generating abnormal HTTP requests, which were unrelated to the attack but added complexity to the investigation.
