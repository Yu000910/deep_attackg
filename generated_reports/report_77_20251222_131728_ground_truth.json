    "clean_text": "On October 15, 2023, APT-Zeta initiated a campaign against a fictional energy company, 'PowerGrid Inc.', by conducting reconnaissance to gather employee email addresses from public sources and leaked databases. The actors then compromised the company's software development pipeline by injecting malicious scripts into build tools, which harvested environment variables and exfiltrated data to a Dropbox account. During execution, the malware employed PowerShell to dynamically load a malicious DLL via shared modules while simultaneously bypassing User Account Control on Windows systems using UACMe techniques. On Linux servers, the adversary modified file permissions with chown commands to gain root access and hijacked execution flow by replacing legitimate binaries with malicious code. For persistence, APT-Zeta flashed a malicious firmware image to the motherboard's management controller, enabling long-term access. Throughout the attack, the actors used Amazon S3 and Google Drive to host additional payloads, evading network detection. System logs from PowerGrid Inc. showed unusual network traffic patterns, but initial investigations attributed these to routine maintenance activities, delaying response. The company, founded in 1998, specializes in renewable energy solutions, with no prior significant security incidents reported.",
