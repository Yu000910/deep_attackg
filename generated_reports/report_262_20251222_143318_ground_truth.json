    "clean_text": "Crimson Hydra, a suspected state-sponsored actor, has been observed targeting financial organizations in North America since early 2024. The campaign begins with reconnaissance, where actors likely gather target information through open-source intelligence. For initial access, the actors exploited a compromised WordPress site to host command-and-control (C2) infrastructure and used stolen VPN credentials to establish a foothold via external remote services. Upon execution, the malware employed PowerShell to download a malicious payload that masqueraded as a legitimate JPEG file by modifying its file signature. For persistence and privilege escalation, the adversary injected code into svchost.exe using system services and exploited an XPC service daemon with weak input validation, while also utilizing DLL side-loading to load malicious DLLs. During lateral movement, the actors enumerated system logs to identify sensitive data and established bidirectional communication with the C2 server via a SOAP Web service. In the impact phase, the malware initiated continuous SSL/TLS renegotiation requests to deplete server resources, causing service exhaustion. System logs from affected servers show increased CPU usage and failed authentication attempts, though these are unrelated to the core techniques. The campaign underscores the need for robust monitoring of web services and external access points.",
