The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to alert organizations about a fictional APT campaign, 'Shadow Echo', which has been observed targeting critical infrastructure entities, including energy and telecommunications sectors. This report is based on simulated threat intelligence for training purposes and does not reflect real-world incidents.

Attack Narrative:
Initial Access: The actors initiated contact by conducting spearphishing voice calls [T1598.004] to impersonate trusted vendors, while simultaneously gathering victim identity information [T1589] from public social media profiles and professional networks to tailor their approach. They researched the target organization's network topology [T1590.004] by scraping public websites for architecture details, such as server layouts and IP ranges.

Execution: Shadow Echo compromised the software supply chain [T1195.002] by trojanizing a legitimate software update binary, and in parallel, they injected malicious firmware into wireless routers during the hardware supply chain [T1195.003] to establish persistent backdoor access. System logs from the victim environment showed unusual network traffic spikes at 03:00 UTC, correlating with the deployment of these payloads.

Persistence: Upon execution, the malware created a scheduled task [T1053.005] to run malicious scripts at system startup, and it established persistence via XDG autostart entries [T1547.013] by adding a hidden .desktop file in the user's autostart directory. Additionally, the adversary installed a systemd timer [T1053.006] to periodically execute data exfiltration routines and modified registry keys [T1112] under HKEY_CURRENT_USER to store configuration data for later use.

Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement: The actors employed Kerberoasting techniques [T1558.003] to extract service account credentials from Active Directory, enabling them to move laterally across the network using SMB/Windows admin shares [T1021.002] to access sensitive files and systems. During this phase, network monitoring tools detected anomalous ARP requests indicative of ARP cache poisoning [T1557.002] as the malware scanned for active hosts on the local subnet.

Collection and Exfiltration: Shadow Echo captured screen images [T1113] of victim desktops, saving them as 'Filter3.jpg' in temporary directories, and used protocol impersonation [T1001.003] with custom HTTP headers to communicate with command-and-control (C2) servers. Data was exfiltrated in small chunks to evade detection, adhering to strict data transfer size limits [T1030] by sending information in 27-character segments. The company's background includes a recent merger, which may have introduced security gaps exploited in this campaign.

Defensive Recommendations: Organizations should implement network segmentation, monitor for unusual scheduled tasks and autostart entries, and enforce strong authentication mechanisms to mitigate similar threats. Regular audits of software and hardware supply chains are also advised.
