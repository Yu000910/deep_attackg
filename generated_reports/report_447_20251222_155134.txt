On June 15, 2024, multiple financial organizations reported suspicious activity leading to service disruptions. Investigation revealed a coordinated attack by the fictional APT group 'SilentShade', leveraging a multi-stage approach. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by searching business databases like RocketReach for employee details [T1597]. Subsequently, they used Instagram direct messages to distribute spearphishing links disguised as photo previews [T1566.003]. Upon victim interaction, a malicious .docx file was delivered, employing Dynamic Data Exchange auto-links to download and execute malware from a remote server [T1559.002]. The malware, once installed, manipulated Mach-O binary load commands to persistently load a harmful dylib [T1546.006] while simultaneously disabling SELinux Role-Based Access Control and deactivating PAM modules to evade security tools [T1562.001]. For lateral movement, the adversary used tools like Inveigh to conduct LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning and SMB relay attacks for credential theft [T1557.001], and they retrieved instructions from a Twitter account for command-and-control guidance [T1102.003]. Finally, to degrade services, they continuously triggered SSL/TLS renegotiation on secure web services, causing excessive CPU utilization and service exhaustion [T1499.002]. Logs from affected systems showed unusual network traffic spikes, but no data exfiltration was confirmed. Organizations are advised to monitor for these indicators and implement robust endpoint and network defenses.
