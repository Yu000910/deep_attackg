The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and National Security Agency (NSA) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional APT campaign. This report is based on simulated threat intelligence and does not reflect real-world incidents. The actors, TEMP.Veles, likely conducted reconnaissance to identify vulnerable external services, but this phase is not detailed in the provided scenario. The campaign begins with initial access, where the adversaries exploited weak credentials to gain entry through a corporate VPN, establishing a foothold in the victim environment [T1133]. System logs from the VPN server show multiple failed login attempts prior to the successful breach, though these were not flagged by the intrusion detection system due to misconfigured thresholds. Once inside, the actors moved to execution and persistence on macOS systems, employing AppleScript [T1059.002] to modify Launch Agent .plist files and create login items [T1547.015] without user interaction, ensuring long-term access. The organization's background includes a recent merger that led to inconsistent security policies across departments, contributing to the oversight. For command and control, TEMP.Veles utilized publish/subscribe protocols [T1071.005] to download encryption keys and additional payloads from remote servers, blending traffic with legitimate application updates. Data exfiltration was conducted through multiple channels: the actors exfiltrated sensitive files over USB drives [T1052.001] by creating hidden logs on connected devices and simultaneously transferred stolen credentials over Bluetooth [T1011.001] to a nearby compromised device, exploiting pairing vulnerabilities. Network monitoring tools recorded unusual spikes in Bluetooth activity, but these were attributed to employee personal devices. Finally, the campaign escalated to impact by leveraging a zero-day flaw in the database management system [T1499.004] to trigger infinite loops, persistently degrading system performance and causing service disruptions. The victim's IT team initially misdiagnosed the performance issues as hardware failures, delaying response. This advisory serves as an educational tool for blue teams to recognize and mitigate such techniques in training exercises.
