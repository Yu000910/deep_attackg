    "clean_text": "APT-FICT, a fictional advanced persistent threat group, has been observed conducting a coordinated campaign against various sectors, including finance and healthcare, since early 2024. Initial analysis indicates the actors likely gained initial access through phishing emails containing malicious attachments, though this phase is not detailed in this report. Upon compromise, the adversary exploited password reuse between a compromised workstation and domain controller to gain unauthorized access to domain accounts. They then employed Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute queries for system information while simultaneously using PowerShell scripts to discover user accounts from local systems and cloud services like Microsoft 365. The reconnaissance efforts extended to cloud environments, where the actors made Graph API queries to identify all registered service principals in the tenant for cloud service discovery and used network scanning tools to identify remote hosts on connected networks for remote system discovery. To maintain access, APT-FICT utilized legitimate remote access tools such as AnyDesk and PuTTy, deploying them across compromised systems to establish persistent connections. During exfiltration, the actors uploaded collected email archives to a remote server using anonymous FTP access over alternative protocols, and prior to this, they manipulated system registry entries with specialized software to alter system behavior for persistence, indicating data manipulation. Logs from affected systems show routine administrative activity, such as scheduled backups and software updates, which were unrelated to the attack. The organization's background includes a recent migration to hybrid cloud infrastructure, increasing its attack surface. This campaign underscores the importance of monitoring for unusual WMI usage and enforcing multi-factor authentication to mitigate risks.",
