The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign dubbed 'Silent Skimmer.' This report simulates real-world tactics for educational purposes, focusing on a multi-stage attack against a fictional e-commerce company, 'RetailFlow Inc.', which operates an online store and uses AWS for cloud infrastructure. The company's IT logs from the past month show increased failed login attempts on admin portals, though initial investigations flagged these as routine noise. Silent Skimmer likely conducts reconnaissance [T1591.004] to identify key network and IT staff roles, such as cloud administrators and developers, by scraping LinkedIn profiles and company directories. Following this, the actors employ phishing for information [T1598] by sending credential-harvesting emails disguised as cloud storage access requests, which led to several employees reporting suspicious links to the security team. Concurrently, the adversary executed a drive-by compromise [T1189] through compromised media websites, redirecting visitors to malicious pages, while also writing a malicious JavaScript file with keylogging capabilities to RetailFlow's e-commerce site scripts folder as a drive-by target [T1608.004]. To further exploit cloud infrastructure, the attackers set up a credential harvesting site imitating the AWS console to collect cloud administrator login information [T1586.003], and they abused Twitter's API to exfiltrate stolen data through direct messages as part of web services exploitation [T1584.006]. Additionally, the malware was scheduled via systemd timers [T1053.006] to exfiltrate data daily at midnight, and it utilized Google Drive to download secondary payloads through web services [T1102]. Incident responders noted unusual network traffic spikes during off-hours, but initial scans did not detect the malicious systemd timers due to misconfigured monitoring tools. This campaign highlights the importance of monitoring for blended techniques in cloud and web environments.
