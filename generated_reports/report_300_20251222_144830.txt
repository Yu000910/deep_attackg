CRIMSON_WAVE likely initiated the attack by exploiting the Windows AUTORUN feature to replicate malware through infected USB drives [T1091], which were distributed via social engineering at a financial conference. Upon insertion, the malware executed a PowerShell script [T1059.001] that downloaded a credential-harvesting DLL [T1556.002] into the Windows temp folder while simultaneously checking for debuggers using the IsDebuggerPresent() API call [T1622] to evade analysis. The DLL was designed to capture passwords through a filter mechanism, and the actor employed Gzip compression [T1132] on command-and-control traffic to avoid detection by network security tools. Additionally, the malware injected malicious content into HTTP responses [T1659] to redirect users to adware sites and utilized video capture capabilities [T1125] to record webcam footage from compromised systems. Finally, exfiltrated data, including sensitive email contacts, was uploaded to text storage sites [T1567.003] for further exploitation. System logs from affected endpoints showed unusual PowerShell activity and network connections to unknown IPs, though some entries were benign updates unrelated to the attack. The financial institution's background includes recent mergers, but this did not directly influence the intrusion vector.
