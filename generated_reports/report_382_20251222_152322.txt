On March 15, 2024, a fictional incident was reported at 'TechGlobal Corp', a mid-sized technology firm with offices in New York and London, where anomalous network traffic was detected originating from an internal workstation. Initial analysis revealed that the threat actors, operating under the alias 'ShadowReaper', likely began their campaign by conducting reconnaissance on the target's digital footprint, though no specific logs were captured for this phase. The actors then utilized legitimate but compromised domains [T1584.001] to host malicious payloads, which were distributed via spearphishing voice calls [T1566.004] where adversaries impersonated Microsoft support personnel, directing a user to install AnyDesk under false pretenses. Once access was gained, the adversary employed a command and scripting interpreter [T1059] to execute remote scripts that simultaneously dropped a counterfeit authentication portal to intercept login attempts on the local network [T1557.004] and performed network service discovery [T1046] using tools like nmap from a compromised router VM to scan ports on restricted segments. Following this, the actors conducted system information discovery [T1082] and system owner/user discovery [T1033] to gather details such as usernames and host configurations, which were then staged locally in subdirectories under %Temp%\reports\ and C:\Users\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\store for screenshots [T1074.001]. Command and control was established using DNS protocols [T1071.004], and the campaign culminated in compute hijacking [T1496.001] where attackers executed a Monero mining script through unsecured Kubernetes API endpoints to exploit resources. Throughout the incident, standard system logs showed routine updates and user activity, but no further anomalies were noted beyond the described behaviors.
