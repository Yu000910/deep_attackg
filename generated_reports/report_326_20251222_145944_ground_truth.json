    "clean_text": "On May 15, 2024, multiple organizations reported anomalous network traffic and unauthorized access to cloud environments. APT-99, believed to operate from Eastern Europe, initiated this campaign by exploiting ISP-level vulnerabilities to inject adware into HTTP responses, redirecting users to phishing pages where they conducted password guessing attacks against corporate mailboxes. System logs from victim networks show increased DNS queries to suspicious domains, though unrelated to the attack. The actors then created a rogue Lambda function in the victim's AWS environment, using serverless execution to run backdoor commands and download additional payloads. This function established multi-stage channels that employed protocol impersonation to mimic TLS encryption, evading SSL inspection by using FakeTLS methods. Internal monitoring tools flagged unusual outbound traffic to Google Cloud Storage, where APT-99 exfiltrated stolen credentials and sensitive documents to a Google Docs file for later retrieval. Company background: The primary victim, FinTech Solutions Inc., reported no prior incidents in Q1 2024, but their legacy systems may have contributed to initial access vectors. Network logs indicate routine maintenance activities during the attack window, which are not tagged as malicious. APT-99's tactics demonstrate a sophisticated blend of network exploitation and cloud-based evasion, requiring coordinated defense measures.",

APT-99 exploited ISP-level vulnerabilities to inject malicious content, leveraged serverless functions for unauthorized execution, and employed multi-stage channels for data exfiltration to cloud storage. The campaign highlights the need for robust network monitoring, cloud security controls, and user awareness training.",
