The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign observed in a simulated environment. Attackers likely initiated reconnaissance by scraping the victim's corporate website to identify key business partners from the 'Partners' page [T1591.002], which informed subsequent spear-phishing efforts. The campaign employed a spear-phishing campaign [T1566] that delivered emails with password-protected ZIP files containing malware executables, while a PowerShell script named phishing.ps1 was used to collect login credentials through fake authentication prompts [T1586.002]. Upon execution, the malware injected its code into notepad.exe to run with the same privileges as the user [T1055.002] and utilized a Unix shell [T1059.004] via a command and scripting interpreter [T1059] with 'bash -c' to execute commands that added a persistent backdoor to the system. The backdoor then used DNS queries [T1071.004] to communicate with a controlled DNS server running on a cloud instance [T1583.002], enabling C2 operations. During post-compromise activities, the malware queried registry values, keys, and data [T1012] to gather system information such as hostname, Windows version, and disk details [T1082], and the attacker executed 'net group /domain' to enumerate all domain-level groups and their members [T1069.002]. System logs from the victim's network showed routine updates to antivirus definitions, but no alerts were triggered during the initial phases. The company, a mid-sized financial firm with operations in three states, reported unusual network latency spikes coinciding with the DNS queries, though these were initially attributed to routine maintenance. Further analysis revealed that the actors maintained persistence through scheduled tasks and modified system binaries, though these techniques are not detailed in this advisory.
