    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide information on a fictional APT campaign for educational purposes. Crimson Tide actors likely conducted reconnaissance on Israeli shipping companies, though no specific logs were identified in this simulation. The campaign began with a supply chain compromise where malicious code was injected into a third-party DLL, malicious_dependency.dll, used by multiple applications across the target network. Concurrently, the actors established a watering hole by compromising the login page of a legitimate Israeli shipping company, creating a drive-by target that collected visitor credentials and other sensitive information. To enhance their infrastructure, Crimson Tide actors acquired and deployed digital certificates on typo-squatted domains to appear more legitimate and evade detection. Once initial access was achieved, the actors employed shared modules by using LoadLibrary calls to load malicious installers and modules via reflective loading or custom shellcode, enabling stealthy execution. For credential theft, the actors intercepted multi-factor authentication codes by registering alternate phone numbers for compromised users to capture SMS-based 2FA, and they modified Entra ID conditional access policies to exempt their IP addresses from MFA requirements, facilitating unauthorized access. Lateral movement was conducted through SSH hijacking by exploiting misconfigured SSH public key authentication to traverse the infrastructure, and the actors abused remote desktop software such as TeamViewer to gain real-time remote desktop access for persistent control. System logs from the target environment showed routine network traffic and user logins, but these were unrelated to the attack and not tagged. The company, 'Global Maritime Logistics', reported no actual financial losses in this training scenario, as it is purely fictional.",

The campaign involves a multi-vector attack combining supply chain compromise, watering hole tactics, and credential theft to achieve persistent access and lateral movement. Blue teams should use this report for training to identify and mitigate similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).",
