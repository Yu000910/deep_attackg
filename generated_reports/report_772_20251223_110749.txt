The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to educate blue teams on a fictional attack scenario involving 'Cobalt Serpent'. This actor initiated reconnaissance by scanning the target network's topology [T1590.004] and used LinkedIn profiles [T1593.001] to identify key employees at GlobalFinCorp, a firm with offices in New York and London focusing on asset management. Following this, the actor exploited password reuse to compromise domain accounts [T1078.002] and abused a patch management system [T1072] to deploy malicious payloads across the network. During execution, the adversary renamed legitimate utilities like certutil [T1036.003] to evade detection while capturing GUI inputs [T1056.002] through fake authentication prompts and taking screen captures [T1113] of sensitive financial data. For command and control, the actor employed non-application layer protocols [T1095] using TCP and UDP, and exfiltrated data over symmetric encrypted non-C2 protocols [T1048.001] by encrypting archives with AES before transfer. Additionally, the campaign involved compute hijacking [T1496.001] by exploiting unsecured Kubernetes APIs to deploy cryptocurrency mining pods, as observed in logs from the DevOps team showing unusual resource spikes. This scenario is purely educational and based on simulated techniques.
