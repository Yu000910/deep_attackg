The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on the activities of the fictional Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group 'ShadowWeaver', observed targeting financial institutions in North America between January and March 2024. This campaign leveraged a multi-vector approach, starting with supply chain compromise and escalating to full network compromise.

Initial Access: The actors initially compromised the software supply chain of a third-party financial application vendor, injecting malicious code into the source repository during the build process to distribute trojanized updates to downstream customers [T1195.002]. Concurrently, they conducted spearphishing campaigns using emails sent from compromised accounts, containing malicious links that redirected victims to credential-harvesting sites when clicked [T1566.002]. Logs from affected systems show increased network traffic to unknown IP addresses during this phase, though some alerts were false positives related to routine software updates.

Execution and Persistence: Upon execution, the malware established persistence by configuring a systemd timer to run a backdoor script every hour, ensuring continuous access to compromised systems [T1053.006]. The backdoor then exploited a known vulnerability in Kerberos to forge tickets and collect authentication credentials from domain controllers, enabling lateral movement across the network [T1212]. System administrators reported unusual login attempts from internal IPs, but initial investigations focused on user error rather than malicious activity.

Credential Access and Data Exfiltration: With elevated privileges, the actors accessed the victim's cloud storage instances, exfiltrating sensitive financial data and customer records over encrypted channels [T1530]. Additionally, the malware included a feature to activate the webcam on compromised machines, capturing video footage for potential blackmail or intelligence gathering [T1125]. Network monitoring tools detected anomalous outbound traffic patterns, but these were initially attributed to backup processes.

Command and Control (C2) and Evasion: To evade detection, the malware employed a commercial VPN service to hide its C2 infrastructure, making it difficult to trace communications back to the adversary [T1665]. Furthermore, the actors leveraged the compromised network to hijack bandwidth resources, using botnet-like behavior to conduct large-scale data exfiltration and DDoS attacks against secondary targets [T1496.002]. Internal security teams noted performance degradation in network services, but root cause analysis was delayed due to ongoing system maintenance.

Mitigation and Recommendations: Organizations are advised to implement strict software supply chain controls, enhance email filtering for spearphishing detection, monitor for unusual persistence mechanisms like systemd timers, and apply patches for known vulnerabilities such as Kerberos exploits. Regular audits of cloud storage access and network traffic analysis can help identify exfiltration and evasion attempts. This fictional scenario underscores the importance of a layered defense strategy in mitigating advanced threats.
