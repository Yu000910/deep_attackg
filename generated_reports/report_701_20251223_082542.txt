The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory in response to observed malicious activity attributed to the fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group 'Saint Bear'. This group has historically targeted financial organizations in North America and Europe, with recent campaigns focusing on mid-sized banks. Background analysis indicates Saint Bear operates from unknown locations, using compromised infrastructure to mask their origins. System logs from affected entities show anomalous network traffic patterns, including increased outbound connections to unknown IP addresses during off-hours, though these logs are not directly linked to the techniques described below. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1598.002] by crafting spearphishing emails with malicious attachments, such as Microsoft Office documents or ZIP archives, to lure victims into opening them [T1566.001]. Once a user interacts with a fake invoice PDF, it prompts execution of a remote access tool via embedded links, leading to user execution [T1204]. After gaining initial access, the adversary exploited a known vulnerability, CVE-2017-0213, to escalate privileges on local systems [T1068] while simultaneously using mshta.exe to execute malicious HTA files from remote domains [T1218.005]. To maintain persistence and hide their activities, they modified file permissions using commands like attrib +h and icacls to grant full access controls to all users [T1222.001] and injected malicious DLLs into legitimate processes to obfuscate command and control communications [T1001]. Additionally, the backdoor wrote IP addresses of operational C2 servers to a text file for dead drop resolution [T1102.001]. Irrelevant network scans detected unrelated port 445 traffic from internal systems, which was later attributed to misconfigured SMB shares and not part of this campaign. The advisory recommends implementing multi-factor authentication, patching known vulnerabilities, and monitoring for unusual file permission changes.
