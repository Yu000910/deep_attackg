The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign. APT-EDU-01, a simulated actor, has been observed exploiting trusted relationships with managed service providers (MSPs) to gain administrative access through delegated permissions [T1199]. Initial access was facilitated by compromising software dependencies, where attackers injected a backdoor via evil.ps1 to establish persistent access and exfiltrate documents [T1195.001]. System logs from the victim organization, a mid-sized financial services firm with hybrid cloud infrastructure, showed unusual PowerShell activity at 03:14 UTC on 2024-10-15, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured monitoring tools. Following initial compromise, the adversary deployed a container using 'docker start' to launch keylogging software while bypassing host intrusion prevention systems [T1610] and simultaneously installed a rogue Chrome extension to establish persistent communication with the attacker's command and control (C2) server [T1176]. The implant then modified secure boot configurations to disable full disk encryption [T1600.002], leveraging AWS Systems Manager to execute commands that modified firewall rules on all EC2 instances [T1072]. During execution, Bundlore malware prompted users for their credentials via GUI input capture [T1056.002] and staged data by running 'cmd.exe /c dir C:\Users > C:\temp\data.txt' to collect user directory listings [T1074]. Exfiltration involved fetching commands from the Twitter account https://twitter.com/c2_instructions to exfiltrate sensitive data [T1102.003] and exploiting Bluetooth HID protocol weaknesses to exfiltrate keystroke logs from infected systems [T1011.001]. Background noise includes routine network scans and false positives from legacy antivirus software, which were logged but not indicative of this campaign. This scenario is designed for educational purposes to enhance detection and response capabilities against multi-stage attacks.
