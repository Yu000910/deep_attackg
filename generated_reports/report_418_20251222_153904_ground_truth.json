    "clean_text": "On 2023-10-15, SHADOW SERPENT initiated a campaign against a fictional energy company, 'VoltGrid Inc.', by registering malicious domains and utilizing virtual private servers to stage encryption keys and payloads. The actors compromised the hardware supply chain by distributing modified Teensy USB devices to VoltGrid's vendors, which were used to infect employee workstations upon connection. Once initial access was achieved, the adversary employed PowerShell to execute vim-cmd commands, creating a new virtual machine for lateral movement within the environment while simultaneously performing network sniffing using a custom tool similar to 'VELVETTAP' to capture packets from compromised F5 BIG-IP devices. This allowed them to conduct input capture through credential harvesting websites, stealing SSH keys and other sensitive data. For command and control, SHADOW SERPENT used non-standard port 4050 to establish one-way communication, downloading and executing additional payloads on infected machines. Finally, the actors exfiltrated the compromised SSH keys by storing them in a GitHub repository via https://api.github.com. System logs from VoltGrid's SIEM showed anomalous traffic spikes on port 4050, but initial alerts were dismissed as false positives due to routine maintenance activities. Background: VoltGrid Inc. is a mid-sized utility provider with operations across the Midwest, and this incident was detected during a routine audit after employees reported unusual USB device behavior.",

The campaign leverages non-standard ports and one-way communication for command and control, with observed activities including network sniffing and input capture to harvest credentials and exfiltrate data to code repositories.",
