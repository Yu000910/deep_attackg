Background: Crimson Veil, a financially motivated actor, has been active since early 2023, focusing on mid-sized banks in North America. This report analyzes a fictional incident at 'SecureBank Corp.', where initial access was gained through a phishing email disguised as a software update [T1566], which harvested employee credentials via a fake login notification [T1589]. Upon execution, the malware conducted internal reconnaissance by downloading tools like Advanced Port Scanner and Lansweeper to map the network [T1590] and accessed VMware VCenter for host configuration details. The adversary then exploited a vulnerable AWS Lambda function to run malicious code in the cloud infrastructure [T1648], while simultaneously collecting credentials from Windows Credential Manager [T1555.004] and capturing GUI inputs through Proton prompts [T1056.002]. Email metadata was exfiltrated using a PowerShell script that launched Outlook.exe [T1114], and malicious browser extensions hooked password manager APIs to silently steal stored credentials [T1056]. For command and control, Dropbox was utilized for bidirectional communication, enabling file uploads, downloads, and arbitrary command execution [T1102.002]. Finally, user documents were gathered and uploaded to a text storage service for exfiltration [T1567.003]. System logs from SecureBank Corp. showed increased network traffic to external IPs, but no actual data loss occurred in this training scenario. The company's incident response team contained the threat within 48 hours, highlighting the importance of multi-factor authentication and regular security audits.
