    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional APT campaign for educational purposes. The actors, designated as 'Sandworm Team', have been observed targeting SOHO network devices in a simulated environment. Initial reconnaissance involved scanning for vulnerable routers and IoT devices, though no specific techniques were tagged in this phase. The campaign began with the actors leveraging a large-scale botnet to distribute malicious links via phishing emails, where users were tricked into clicking on decoy landing pages hosted on platforms like Google Docs. Upon execution, the actors employed a custom heap spray exploit crafted for browser-based attacks to gain initial foothold on victim systems. System logs from the simulated network show increased HTTP traffic to unknown domains, but this was not flagged by standard alerts. To maintain access, the actors inserted a passive network tap to collect data covertly while modifying the HKLM\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Notify registry key to establish persistence through logon notifications. Additionally, they used process doppelgänging techniques to write malicious executables into memory via TxF transactions, evading detection by traditional antivirus solutions. For command and control, the actors utilized web protocols such as HTTP to communicate with their infrastructure, blending in with normal network traffic. Exfiltration was conducted by encrypting collected credentials using AES and sending them over HTTPS, mimicking legitimate encrypted traffic. The company background includes a fictional SOHO provider with outdated firmware on routers, but this detail is not directly related to the attack techniques. Blue teams should monitor for unusual registry changes, anomalous web traffic, and memory manipulation indicators to detect similar activities.",

The campaign involves initial access via malicious links, exploitation of browser vulnerabilities, establishment of persistence through registry modifications, and exfiltration over encrypted protocols. Blue teams should review this report for training on detecting and mitigating similar tactics.",
