    "clean_text": "SilentBoard actors likely initiated their campaign by conducting active scanning to identify vulnerable IP ranges within the target organization's network infrastructure, while simultaneously identifying key roles through social engineering and open-source intelligence to tailor their attacks. Using spearphishing voice, the actors impersonated trusted contacts to gather initial intelligence and establish footholds. They then compromised domains to host malicious content and executed phishing campaigns with tailored emails containing malicious attachments. Upon user execution of these attachments, the malware leveraged content injection to modify DNS queries and redirect traffic to adversary-controlled servers. The actors employed PowerShell via cloud API to download additional payloads and modify registry keys, while installing a security support provider to maintain persistence and bypass authentication mechanisms. They further patched system images through FTP downloads to embed backdoors and dumped LSA secrets to extract credentials from registry keys. To conceal their activities, the group used data obfuscation via DLL injection into legitimate processes and launched direct network floods with UDP packets to degrade services. Finally, they executed disk structure wipes to destroy data and prevent system recovery, as part of their disruptive objectives. Throughout the campaign, routine system logs showed increased network traffic and failed login attempts, though these were initially dismissed as minor anomalies by the IT team.",
