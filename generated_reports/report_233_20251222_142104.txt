The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with a fictional, educational scenario based on observed TTPs. APT-42, a sophisticated cyber actor, initiated this campaign by compromising a public GitHub gist [T1584.006] to host command and control (C2) configuration data, which was later retrieved via scheduled tasks. Initial access was achieved through password guessing attacks [T1110.001] against a list of mailboxes, leveraging weak credentials in an Office 365 environment. Once inside, the actors used valid cloud accounts [T1078.004] to deploy the Pacu tool for reconnaissance and privilege escalation, adding Global Admin roles [T1098.003] to an existing account to expand access. For persistence, the malware employed schtasks.exe to schedule data_exfil.exe every 30 minutes [T1053] and configured Image File Execution Options Injection [T1546.012] by modifying HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\winlogon.exe to execute a script upon process exit. Lateral movement involved using the Hypervisor CLI [T1059.012] to execute vim-cmd and create a new virtual machine, while remote service session hijacking [T1563] was used to compromise RDP sessions on domain-joined workstations. Data exfiltration was conducted over FTP [T1071.002] and unencrypted HTTP posts [T1048.003], mimicking variants that posted data to a web server. The actors also accessed cloud secrets management stores [T1555.006] using 'gcloud secrets describe api-keys' to harvest API credentials from Google Cloud. Disruption tactics included application exhaustion floods [T1499.003] with repeated HTTP POST requests to login endpoints and weaponizing a zero-day vulnerability [T1499.004] in a database management system to cause persistent unavailability. System logs from the affected environment showed routine backup processes running at 02:00 UTC, but these were unrelated to the attack. The company, a mid-sized financial services firm with offices in North America and Europe, reported no prior incidents in the last quarter, though network latency spikes were noted during the campaign.
