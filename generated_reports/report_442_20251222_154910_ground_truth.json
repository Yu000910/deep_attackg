    "clean_text": "On June 15, 2024, network administrators at a fictional energy company, 'PowerGrid Inc.', discovered a passive tap attached to the Ethernet line in the server room during a routine inspection. This hardware addition was likely installed by an intruder posing as a maintenance technician two weeks prior. Following this physical breach, the adversary leveraged cloud administration tools to execute malicious commands via Azure RunCommand, which deleted system log files and obfuscated forensic evidence. To establish persistent access, the actors replaced magnify.exe with a custom backdoor, enabling remote SYSTEM-level privileges on compromised endpoints. Concurrently, the threat actor deployed a Wi-Fi Pineapple to create an evil twin access point, performing SSL stripping on HTTPS connections to intercept unencrypted credentials from employees connecting to the corporate network. For lateral movement, the group utilized the SMB protocol to mimic standard file-sharing operations and propagate across systems, while simultaneously deploying a Monero cryptocurrency mining tool to hijack computational resources for financial gain. System logs from affected servers showed unusual spikes in CPU usage, averaging 95% over several days, though initial alerts were dismissed as routine maintenance activities. PowerGrid Inc., established in 1995, operates multiple substations across the region, with no prior significant security incidents reported.",
