Background: 'ShadowLink' is a fictional APT group assessed to operate with state-sponsored objectives, focusing on financial data exfiltration. In this simulated incident, the campaign targeted a mid-sized bank, 'SecureTrust Financial', over a three-month period starting in early 2024. Initial logs from SecureTrust's SIEM showed anomalous network traffic spikes, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to obfuscated container activity.

Attack Narrative:
1. Reconnaissance and Initial Access: The actors conducted social engineering by establishing a fake LinkedIn account [T1585] with a fabricated profile posing as a cybersecurity consultant, which they used to connect with SecureTrust employees. Through this account, they delivered spearphishing messages via LinkedIn's messaging service [T1566.003], attaching a malicious PDF file disguised as a security whitepaper.
2. Execution and Persistence: Upon execution, the malware leveraged PowerShell to deploy a Docker container [T1610] that masked command and control (C2) traffic, while simultaneously using AppleScript to display a fake authentication dialog [T1056.002] that captured user credentials and enumerated local account names [T1087.001] from the compromised system.
3. Collection and Exfiltration: The adversary collected sensitive financial documents and used QuickZip to archive the stolen files [T1560.001] before exfiltrating them via encrypted POP3S protocols [T1071.003] to a compromised email account, while employing fast flux DNS techniques [T1568.001] to rotate C2 domains and disrupt forensic analysis by de-registering DNS A records.

Additional Context: SecureTrust's incident response team noted that the Docker container ran undetected for two weeks due to its low resource usage, mimicking legitimate services. Network logs showed intermittent connections to IP addresses in Eastern Europe, but these were later attributed to fast flux DNS obfuscation. The bank has since implemented enhanced email filtering and container security monitoring, with no real data loss reported in this fictional scenario.
