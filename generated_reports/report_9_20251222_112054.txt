The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional ransomware campaign, designated as 'ShadowPropagate,' observed in a simulated corporate environment. This campaign targeted a mid-sized financial services company, 'SecureFin Corp,' with operations across North America and Europe, where initial access was gained through exploitation of default local administrator accounts [T1078.001] on several unpatched Windows servers running legacy applications. System logs from the incident show multiple failed login attempts prior to successful authentication, though these were initially dismissed as routine noise. Following initial access, the actors employed svchost.exe to load a malicious DLL for keylogging [T1569], which hooked into system processes to capture user inputs [T1056] and specifically gathered keystrokes from compromised machines [T1056.001], including credentials entered during authentication prompts. To evade detection, the malware exploited COM objects to bypass application whitelisting and execute unauthorized programs [T1559], while simultaneously using process hollowing techniques to inject malicious code into legitimate processes like explorer.exe [T1055.012]. The campaign escalated privileges by executing DCSync attacks to retrieve domain credential hashes from LSASS memory [T1003.006], enabling lateral movement via SSH with stolen credentials to access remote database servers [T1021]. For data exfiltration, the actors compressed stolen files using the C# GZipStream compression class via library methods [T1560.002] and manipulated runtime data in critical applications to display fake error messages instead of legitimate output [T1565.003], hindering user awareness. Command and control communications were obfuscated through fast flux DNS for resilient IP resolution [T1568.001], with network traffic showing sporadic spikes in DNS queries to domains associated with known threat actors. Throughout the campaign, the actors maintained persistence by modifying registry keys and scheduling tasks, though these actions were not tagged as they fall outside the specified techniques. This narrative serves as a training tool to highlight the importance of monitoring for default account usage, anomalous process behaviors, and network anomalies in defensive strategies.
