    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on the activities of the fictional threat actor 'ShadowFirm,' which targeted a critical infrastructure organization in the energy sector. The organization, 'PowerGrid Inc.,' reported anomalous network traffic and unauthorized access to administrative systems, prompting an investigation that revealed a coordinated attack. Background checks on PowerGrid Inc. indicated no prior significant breaches, but system logs from the past month showed increased failed login attempts from unknown IP addresses, which were initially dismissed as noise. The attack began with the actors conducting reconnaissance by querying the GetCredentialType API to identify corporate email addresses, specifically targeting high-level executives and IT administrators. Concurrently, they compromised the hardware supply chain by flashing malicious firmware onto a network-attached storage device deployed at a remote office, creating a hidden access point. This device served as an initial foothold, allowing the actors to execute malicious scripts using PowerShell to download additional payloads and establish persistence. Once inside the network, they leveraged SMB/Windows Admin Shares by using hardcoded credentials to authenticate via NTLMSSP and move laterally across systems, while employing web protocols through a .NET HTTPListener class to receive and handle HTTP POST requests for command and control. System logs from the compromised storage device showed unusual outbound traffic to external domains, but these were initially overlooked due to routine maintenance activities. The actors' activities were detected after an internal audit flagged unauthorized access to sensitive administrative shares, leading to the discovery of the hidden firmware and subsequent containment efforts.",
