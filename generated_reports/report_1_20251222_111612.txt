The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign, 'ShadowFlood', observed targeting energy infrastructure in a simulated environment. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance to map network topology [T1590.004] while simultaneously harvesting credentials through a compromised website hosting fake authentication forms [T1589.001]. Following this, they developed custom malware.exe with anti-analysis capabilities [T1587] and used Visual Basic scripts [T1059.005] to execute payloads that modified registry keys [T1112] and installed backdoors as Windows services [T1543.003]. The malware facilitated ingress tool transfer [T1105] to download additional encrypted backdoors, and the actors leveraged valid accounts [T1078] for persistence and lateral movement across the network. In a disruptive phase, the attackers exploited unsecured IoT light bulbs to amplify reflection attacks through a botnet [T1583.005], culminating in direct network floods [T1498.001] that disrupted HTTPS services. System logs from the fictional 'PowerGrid Inc.' showed anomalous traffic spikes on port 443, with network devices reporting configuration changes unrelated to the attack. The company, a mid-sized utility provider, had recently upgraded its firewall firmware, but this did not prevent the initial access via credential theft.
