    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign designated 'ShadowNet.' This campaign targeted multiple U.S. critical infrastructure entities between January and March 2024, with initial access often gained through SEO poisoning where actors embedded hidden div elements with high-traffic keywords to lure victims to compromised websites. Concurrently, the actors conducted spearphishing via service by creating fake Instagram profiles that shared links to malware-infected mobile applications, while also compromising IoT devices with unpatched firmware to build a botnet for coordinated attacks. Upon execution, the malware utilized Unix shell via /bin/bash to run commands and employed stripped payloads by modifying compiler settings to remove symbol tables, evading detection. For persistence and lateral movement, the actors used template injection in docx files to embed scripts connecting to command and control servers, transferred tools within victim environments using SMB/Windows admin shares, and established remote access tools such as tmate sessions for C2 communications. To facilitate data exfiltration, the malware connected to unprotected Wi-Fi networks to transmit collected data, and actors disabled or modified the system firewall by running netsh commands to create exceptions for malicious traffic. In later stages, the campaign involved external defacement by modifying index.html files to display false outage notifications, and application or system exploitation through a zero-day buffer overflow vulnerability to cause persistent instability and service unavailability. Logs from affected systems showed unusual SMB activity and firewall rule changes, though some entries were unrelated to the attack, such as routine software updates and user login attempts from authorized IP addresses. Background checks revealed that targeted organizations had recently expanded their digital footprints, but this information did not directly correlate with the intrusion methods used.",

The campaign targeted organizations in the energy and healthcare sectors, leveraging techniques such as Unix shell execution, stripped payloads, and remote access tools for persistence and data exfiltration. Blue teams are advised to review logs for signs of SMB transfers, firewall modifications, and unexpected network connections to mitigate similar threats.",
