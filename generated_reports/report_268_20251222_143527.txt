The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the fictional APT group 'NIGHTFALL.' This group has been active since early 2024, focusing on entities in the financial and technology sectors, with observed incidents involving data theft and resource hijacking. In one simulated attack, the actors initiated access by compromising legitimate websites to distribute malicious browser updates, leading to drive-by compromises [T1189] that infected users visiting these sites. Upon infection, the malware established persistence by exploiting external remote services [T1133], such as TeamViewer and AnyDesk, to maintain remote access without triggering standard security alerts. System logs from the victim environment, including routine network traffic and user login attempts, showed no immediate anomalies during this phase, though later analysis revealed unusual outbound connections to cloud storage platforms. The adversaries then executed payloads by modifying cron jobs on Linux systems to schedule cryptocurrency mining during off-peak hours [T1053.003], while on Windows systems, they altered registry keys to run logon scripts [T1037.001] for automatic execution upon user login. During data collection, the group archived sensitive information, such as financial documents and internal communications, using compression tools [T1560] and queried messaging application APIs [T1213.005] to extract shared files related to merger plans. Additionally, they accessed cloud storage environments [T1530] to search for VPN configurations and MFA details, leveraging symmetric cryptography [T1573.001] to encrypt command-and-control communications with XOR operations. To evade detection, the actors implemented port knocking [T1205.001] by sending a series of TCP-SYN packets to specific ports before opening a backdoor, while routine system maintenance logs indicated normal disk usage spikes unrelated to the attack. This campaign underscores the need for robust monitoring of web traffic, remote service usage, and scheduled tasks to mitigate such threats.
