On October 15, 2023, multiple energy sector organizations reported suspicious activity following a spearphishing campaign [T1598.003] that delivered malicious links to adversary-controlled websites, leading to credential harvesting. Initial analysis revealed that the malware, upon execution, invoked systeminfo.exe to query host firmware details [T1592.003] before proceeding with the attack chain. The threat actors had previously uploaded ransomware components to IPFS nodes [T1608.001] to ensure persistent availability, and they employed an AI-driven persistence mechanism [T1588.007] that executed malicious.ps1 every hour to maintain access to compromised systems. System logs from a vulnerable web server showed unauthorized access attempts, culminating in the deployment of a web shell [T1650] for persistent control. Investigation uncovered that the initial intrusion involved compromising the software supply chain [T1195.002], where malware was inserted into a third-party monitoring tool used by the targets, similar to the SUNSPOT incident. During execution, the malware used various Native API calls [T1106] to evade sandbox detection, and on Unix-based systems, it employed a shell script [T1059.004] as the main executable, dropping an embedded base64-encoded payload to the /tmp folder. Once established, the actors conducted remote system discovery [T1018] by scanning the local network segment for exploitable systems, and they used Pass the Hash techniques [T1550.002] with tools like Mimikatz for lateral movement. To maintain covert communication, the threat actor modified Exchange transport agent settings to intercept and forward all emails from the finance department [T1114.003], and they received C2 instructions from user profiles on legitimate websites such as GitHub [T1102.003]. Exfiltration activities included using compromised access tokens to collect system configuration files and store them in a GitHub Gist via the GitHub API [T1567.001], as well as establishing a persistent cellular data link for continuous data exfiltration [T1011]. Finally, after exfiltrating data, the actors initiated a system shutdown/reboot [T1529] to destroy files and wipe the MBR, mimicking tactics used by groups like Lazarus. Background noise: The targeted organizations, including 'PowerGrid Inc.' and 'EnergyFlow Corp.', reported no prior incidents in Q3 2023, and routine firewall logs showed normal traffic patterns until the attack.
