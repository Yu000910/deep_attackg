The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training insights into a fictional APT campaign, 'ShadowGale'. This group has been observed targeting financial organizations in North America and Europe. Background checks indicate the actors operate from a region with high cybercriminal activity, though attribution remains unconfirmed. Initial analysis of network logs from a victim bank showed unusual outbound traffic on port 443, but this was later determined to be a false positive related to a scheduled backup. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance by accessing private data broker services to acquire sensitive corporate information about targets [T1597]. They then purchased hosting servers with virtual currency and prepaid cards [T1583.004] to support their infrastructure. The adversary wrote a credential dumping tool to extract password hashes from Windows domain controllers [T1587] and injected hidden text containing popular search terms into the compromised website's footer [T1608.006] to lure victims. A compromised script executed Mimikatz.exe to extract NTLM hashes from local system accounts [T1078.003] while leveraging legitimate remote management tools to maintain persistent access [T1133]. For execution, they exploited Adobe Flash vulnerability CVE-2015-8651 [T1203] and used packers such as Themida to obfuscate malicious files [T1027.002]. To establish persistence, they set LoadAppInit_DLLs in the Registry key SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows [T1546.010] and employed COM hijacking [T1546.015]. For defense evasion, PowerShell.exe was executed to disable Windows Defender real-time protection [T1211]. Finally, they used legitimate utilities such as AnyDesk and PuTTy for maintaining remote access to victim environments [T1219]. Incident responders noted that system performance degradation was initially attributed to a recent software update, but further investigation revealed malicious activity. The campaign's timeline suggests initial access occurred over a holiday weekend, exploiting reduced staffing levels.
