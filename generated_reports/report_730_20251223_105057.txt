Crimson Tempest likely conducted reconnaissance by scanning network security appliances [T1590.006] to gather victim host information [T1592], while simultaneously acquiring scalable cloud infrastructure [T1583] to deploy phishing sites. The actors exploited a vulnerable public-facing web application [T1190] for initial access, then employed AWS Systems Manager commands [T1651] to execute lateral movement across cloud environments while modifying the Security Support Provider registry key [T1547.005] to load a credential harvesting DLL. Persistence was established by configuring installer packages [T1546.016] to run custom executables, and the adversary extracted cached domain credentials [T1003.005] from LSASS memory while enumerating local accounts [T1087.001] using NetUserEnum. Network service discovery [T1046] was performed via port scanning to identify additional targets, and the malware implemented virtualization evasion [T1497] by sleeping between C2 attempts to avoid sandbox detection. Data exfiltration involved using IDE tunneling [T1219.001] to bypass network controls, with C2 traffic encoded in Base64 [T1132.001] and exfiltrated over unencrypted HTTP protocols [T1048.003] by splitting files into chunks [T1030] to avoid size limits, while a network sniffer captured transmitted authentication credentials [T1565.002] for manipulation. System logs from the victim's firewall showed routine traffic spikes unrelated to the attack, and the organization's background in financial services provided no direct correlation to the intrusion vector.
