On October 15, 2023, 'Silent Echo' initiated reconnaissance by searching Facebook for employees who recently joined 'TechGlobal Inc.' [T1593]. The actors then deployed spearphishing attacks, sending a malicious attachment that dropped a .ps1 file in the Temp directory to prompt credential re-entry [T1598.002], while simultaneously using a malicious mobile app to record ambient conversations through device microphones without consent [T1598.004]. To expand their foothold, they compromised the supply chain by altering the continuous integration server configuration to deploy malware-laden software updates [T1195] and injected malicious firmware into network routers to establish persistent backdoor access [T1195.003]. For execution and persistence, they manipulated a system service to run malicious.dll via svchost.exe for command and control [T1569], modified the kernel's networking module to maintain these channels [T1547.006], bypassed User Account Control using the CMSTPLUA COM interface [T1548.002], and performed dynamic linker hijacking by injecting a malicious.so to override legitimate functions [T1574.006]. Additionally, the group conducted credential attacks, performing password-spraying against public-facing services to validate credentials [T1110.003], and encoded command and control traffic with Base64 to evade detection [T1132.001]. In a disruptive phase, they executed an application exhaustion flood with sustained requests to the image processing service, causing rendering delays [T1499.003]. System logs from TechGlobal Inc. showed unusual network traffic spikes, but routine maintenance activities were also recorded, including database backups and firewall updates, which are unrelated to the attack. The company's background includes operations in 50 countries with over 10,000 employees, focusing on cloud services and IoT solutions, though this information does not directly correlate with the intrusion. Analysis indicates the campaign aimed at data exfiltration and operational disruption, requiring immediate defensive actions.
