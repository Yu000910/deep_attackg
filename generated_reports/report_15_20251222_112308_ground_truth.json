    "clean_text": "On October 15, 2023, APT-99 initiated reconnaissance against a U.S.-based financial services firm, 'FinSecure Inc.', by searching the company's public Facebook page to identify seasonal business tempo patterns, such as increased activity during tax season. Concurrently, the actors used dig commands to gather intelligence on FinSecure's DNS infrastructure, including security appliances like firewalls and DNS servers. This information was used to tailor subsequent attacks. In early November, APT-99 compromised the software supply chain of a third-party vendor used by FinSecure, substituting an authentic software update package with a malicious executable containing spyware and backdoor functionality. The malicious update was distributed via email campaigns that included malicious links disguised as legitimate notifications, luring employees into downloading the payload. Upon execution, the malware established command and control (C2) channels using GitHub repositories and a public blog service in Hong Kong for bidirectional communication, enabling data exfiltration and receiving further instructions. System logs from FinSecure's endpoints showed unusual PowerShell activity, but no immediate alerts were triggered. The malware then employed direct volume access techniques to bypass file locks and encrypt critical financial data, including files currently open and in use by applications, leading to operational disruption. Incident response teams noted encrypted files with .APT99 extensions and anomalous network traffic to external IP addresses, though initial firewall rules did not block these connections. FinSecure, established in 1995, reported no prior significant breaches, but this incident highlights vulnerabilities in third-party software management.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a fictional, simulated campaign by a threat actor group, designated as APT-99, targeting financial institutions in the United States. The campaign leverages software supply chain compromise and social engineering to deploy ransomware, with activities observed from reconnaissance to data encryption. This report is for educational purposes to train blue teams on identifying and mitigating such tactics.",
