PhantomHive, a fictional APT group, has been observed targeting organizations with hybrid IT infrastructures. The campaign begins with the exploitation of a vulnerable Microsoft Exchange Server using CVE-2021-26855 [T1190], allowing initial access. Upon compromise, the actors employ Component Object Model (COM) interfaces [T1559.001] to schedule malicious tasks via ITaskService, while simultaneously establishing persistence through Active Setup by modifying registry keys in the StubPath [T1547.014]. To evade security controls, they use compromised credentials to alter Okta conditional access policies, removing device compliance requirements [T1556.009]. For discovery, PhantomHive executes PowerShell scripts to gather locale-specific data for geolocation [T1614] and uses tools like ListBuckets to identify cloud storage locations [T1580], while performing SNMP walks to map network topology [T1602.001] and querying Confluence for infrastructure details [T1213.001]. To move laterally, they inject forged Kerberos tickets into sessions to access domain controllers [T1550.003]. Before exfiltration, the group archives collected data using encryption [T1560] and employs domain generation algorithms for command and control communications [T1568.002]. Data is exfiltrated over asymmetric encrypted non-C2 protocols, such as OpenSSL-encrypted network maps [T1048.002]. The campaign concludes with endpoint denial-of-service attacks, exploiting a buffer overflow in Apache web servers to crash services [T1499]. System logs from affected servers show increased CPU usage and failed login attempts, though these are unrelated to the core techniques. Company background: The targeted organization, a mid-sized financial firm, had recently migrated some operations to AWS, but legacy systems remained on-premises, creating a complex attack surface.
