Storm-1811, a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has been observed targeting financial and technology sectors in a coordinated campaign dubbed 'VoicePhantom'. The actors initiate contact via voice calls [T1566.004], posing as IT support to trick users into downloading and executing malicious scripts. Upon execution, the malware employs COM hijacking [T1559] to replace legitimate COM objects with malicious ones, ensuring persistence and code execution upon system activation. The adversary then leverages the Lua interpreter [T1059.011] to execute system commands for reconnaissance and data collection while using BITSAdmin [T1570] to create BITS jobs for lateral tool transfer across SMB file servers. Internally, the malware drops a PowerShell script [T1534] that executes commands to compromise additional domain accounts and utilizes multi-stage channels [T1104] through scripts like 'host_info.ps1' to collect network adapter settings and user privileges. All command-and-control traffic is encrypted with AES [T1573.001] to obscure communications, and the malware writes a PowerShell script named 'malicious.ps1' to the %TEMP% directory [T1029] to prepare for scheduled data exfiltration. Background noise: The campaign was first detected in Q3 2024, with initial incidents reported at a mid-sized software company, where system logs showed unusual PowerShell activity at 02:00 UTC, coinciding with scheduled maintenance windows. The company's internal firewall recorded multiple failed SMB connection attempts from compromised workstations, but no alerts were triggered due to misconfigured thresholds.
