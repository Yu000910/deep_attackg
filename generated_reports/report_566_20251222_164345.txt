The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign designated 'ShadowHaze'. This campaign targeted multiple financial institutions over a six-month period, exploiting vulnerabilities in external services and employee behaviors. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by gathering passive DNS information from historical query logs to map target network infrastructure [T1590.002]. They then utilized a botnet of compromised machines as proxy nodes [T1584.005] and exploited AWS Lambda functions to rotate IP addresses, avoiding reputation-based blocking [T1584.007]. Initial access was achieved through spearphishing emails with malicious attachments [T1566.001] and by exploiting an open Wi-Fi network at a public coffee shop to intercept credentials [T1669]. Once inside, the adversary created a scheduled task via schtasks.exe to run a keylogger daily at midnight [T1053] while using the GetLocaleInfoW API function to discover the system's location settings [T1614]. For command and control, the malware bypassed egress filtering by querying DNS MX records with hidden data [T1568.003] and executed PowerShell scripts to initiate scheduled data exfiltration [T1029]. System logs from infected endpoints showed unusual network traffic patterns, including connections to unknown IP addresses in the 10.0.0.0/8 range, but no direct evidence of data loss was confirmed in this simulation. The company background involves a mid-sized bank with hybrid cloud infrastructure, where employees frequently use personal devices on corporate networks, increasing attack surface. Remediation steps include implementing DNS filtering, enforcing multi-factor authentication, and monitoring for anomalous scheduled tasks.
