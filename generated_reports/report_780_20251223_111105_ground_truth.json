    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional threat actor, 'ShadowMiner', observed targeting financial and healthcare sectors. The campaign begins with reconnaissance activities, where actors scan for misconfigured AWS environments, though no specific technique IDs are assigned to this phase. Subsequently, the actors exploited AWS Lambda functions to dynamically rotate IP addresses and evade reputation-based blocking, while simultaneously using default Administrator accounts with weak passwords like 'admin123' to gain initial access to Windows servers. Once inside, they employed PowerShell to schedule malicious tasks via schtasks.exe with elevated privileges and used CreateProcess to hollow out a clean svchost.exe instance for stealthy code injection. System logs from the compromised server show normal application errors unrelated to the attack. The malware then modified the PATH environment variable to include a directory with malicious executables, enabling path interception, and compressed stolen data using the aPLib library for archiving. Additionally, the actors used PowerShell to invoke Outlook.exe and collect email folder contents, while establishing command and control via the Stratum protocol on port 10001 for cryptojacking communication. Finally, the backdoor automated exfiltration by extracting sensitive_docs.zip from a shared network drive. Company background: The targeted organization, 'MediFin Corp', operates a hybrid cloud setup with legacy systems, but this information is not tagged as it is irrelevant to the kill-chain analysis.",

The campaign exploits serverless functions for evasion, leverages default credentials for initial access, and employs sophisticated persistence and exfiltration techniques, including cryptojacking and data theft. Blue teams should review logs for suspicious AWS Lambda activity, default account usage, and anomalous process behaviors.",
