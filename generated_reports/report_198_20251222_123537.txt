Background: Chimera is a fictitious advanced persistent threat (APT) group believed to operate with financial and espionage motives, targeting organizations in the financial services and technology sectors. This report is based on a simulated incident at 'FinTech Global Inc.', a mid-sized company specializing in digital payment solutions, with no prior significant security breaches noted in its logs from the past quarter.

Initial Access: The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify potential entry points, though specific details are omitted for training realism. They then used legitimate credentials obtained through unspecified means to access external remote services [T1133], including a corporate VPN and Citrix environment, logging in from IP addresses associated with residential proxies in Europe. System logs show multiple failed login attempts for user accounts that were not targeted in this campaign, indicating noise from unrelated brute-force attacks.

Execution: Upon gaining access, Chimera employed PowerShell [T1059.001] to download and execute a cryptojacking script purchased from a darknet vendor [T1588], which mined cryptocurrency while simultaneously deploying custom malware named 'backdoor.exe' with keylogging and remote control capabilities [T1587.001]. The malware was designed to evade detection by mimicking legitimate system processes, and initial execution triggered alerts in the endpoint protection system, but these were dismissed as false positives due to high network traffic from a scheduled backup job.

Persistence: To maintain access, the adversary created a CronJob in a Kubernetes cluster [T1053.007] to deploy a container that collects and transmits sensitive configuration data weekly, while also using dynamic linker hijacking [T1574.006] by setting LD_PRELOAD to inject a malicious shared module into programs launched by SSH sessions, hooking functions like system and execve from libc. Additionally, they modified the SAM database to change password hashes for existing user accounts [T1556], ensuring continued access even if credentials were reset. Logs from the identity management system showed routine password changes by IT staff, unrelated to the malicious activity.

Privilege Escalation and Discovery: Chimera extracted password hashes from the ntds.dit file [T1110.002] to crack them offline, gaining elevated privileges, and conducted system language discovery [T1614.001] by calling GetKeyboardType to detect if the compromised host had a Japanese keyboard, though the system was configured for English. They also performed software discovery [T1518] using a script similar to 'DeployJava.js' to fingerprint installed applications, identifying vulnerable software versions prior to further exploitation. Network traffic analysis revealed benign scans from internal security tools, adding noise to the discovery phase.

Lateral Movement and Command and Control: The actors deployed an unauthorized VNC server [T1021.005] on the endpoint to facilitate remote control, allowing direct interaction with the desktop environment. For command and control, they established bidirectional communication [T1102.002] through events in Google Calendar, using encoded messages to exfiltrate data and receive instructions. This method blended with legitimate calendar usage by employees, making detection challenging. Incident response teams noted anomalous outbound connections to cloud services, but these were initially attributed to a new marketing campaign rollout.

Impact and Mitigation: The campaign resulted in data exfiltration of sensitive financial records and unauthorized cryptocurrency mining, causing resource depletion. FinTech Global Inc. has since implemented enhanced monitoring for container orchestration jobs and external service logins, though no real data loss occurred as this is a training exercise. Blue teams are advised to review logs for the techniques described and simulate response procedures.
