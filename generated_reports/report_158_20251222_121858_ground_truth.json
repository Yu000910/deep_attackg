    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training insights into a fictional APT campaign designated 'ShadowLink'. This report is based on simulated threat intelligence and does not reflect real-world incidents. The actors likely began by conducting passive reconnaissance through DNS queries to map subdomains and identify potential entry points, while simultaneously purchasing credentials and session tokens from underground forums to facilitate initial access. Following this, they executed active scanning using tools like nmap.exe to probe the victim's IP range for vulnerabilities and scanned for open Wi-Fi networks to exploit weak wireless security. In the execution phase, the adversary employed a social engineering tactic by displaying a fake 'System Update Required' error message to trick users into copying and pasting malicious code, which led to payload deployment. Post-exploitation, the actors cleared select Windows event logs and removed network share connections using commands like 'net use \\\\server\\share /delete' to obscure their activities. They further conducted discovery by running 'gpresult /z' to gather detailed Group Policy information. For command and control, ShadowLink utilized publish/subscribe protocols such as Jabber/XMPP to communicate with C2 servers, with traffic encrypted and encoded using Base64 to evade detection. Additional system logs from the victim environment showed routine backup processes and unrelated firewall alerts, which were not indicative of malicious activity. The campaign's infrastructure included domains registered in the past six months, with no ties to known APT groups in real-world databases.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by the fictional threat actor group 'ShadowLink', which has been observed targeting critical infrastructure sectors, including energy and telecommunications, through a multi-stage attack leveraging initial reconnaissance, credential theft, and persistent command-and-control (C2) mechanisms. The campaign involves techniques such as DNS reconnaissance, purchasing technical data, active scanning, Wi-Fi exploitation, user deception via malicious copy-paste, event log clearing, network share removal, Group Policy discovery, and use of publish/subscribe protocols with standard encoding for C2 traffic. Blue teams are advised to review defensive measures, including network segmentation, log monitoring, and user awareness training.",
