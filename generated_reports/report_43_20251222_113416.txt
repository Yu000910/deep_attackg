On October 15, 2023, security teams at 'Global Energy Corp' detected anomalous activity in their network, leading to the identification of a sophisticated intrusion campaign. The company, a major provider of energy services with operations across North America, reported unusual login attempts and scheduled tasks on domain controllers. Initial investigation revealed that the adversary likely conducted reconnaissance by purchasing technical data such as credentials and session tokens from underground forums [T1597.002] while simultaneously searching victim-owned websites for contact forms to redirect users to malicious URLs [T1594]. Additionally, the actors collected organizational details from paid intelligence services [T1597] and created fake social media profiles on LinkedIn to gather employee information [T1585.001]. The campaign began with spearphishing emails containing malicious links sent to targeted employees [T1566.002], leading to the execution of PowerShell scripts [T1059.001] that downloaded payloads and scheduled malicious tasks [T1053] on compromised systems. For persistence, the adversary modified system images by altering library files to disable security checks [T1601] and installed a backdoor by modifying domain controller authentication processes [T1556.001]. Lateral movement was achieved using pass the hash techniques via PowerShell utilities [T1550.002], while command and control traffic was masked using external proxies to evade detection [T1090.002]. System logs from 'Global Energy Corp' showed increased network traffic to unknown IP addresses, but no data exfiltration was confirmed. The company's incident response team isolated affected systems and initiated forensic analysis, with ongoing monitoring for further activity. This scenario highlights the importance of multi-layered defenses and continuous threat hunting in critical infrastructure environments.
