The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a simulated APT campaign, 'SHADOWFLUX,' which has been observed targeting financial organizations in a fictional scenario. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance by gathering passive DNS information [T1590.002] and fingerprinting remote system hardware using tools like nmap.exe [T1592.001]. Initial access was achieved through compromised credentials, leading to the execution phase where the adversary employed AppleScript [T1059.002] to create login items for persistence and AutoHotKey/AutoIT scripts [T1059.010] dropped to hidden directories, such as `test.au3`, to automate malicious activities. For persistence, the actors used a tool similar to GREASE to add a Windows admin account [T1078.003], enabling continued access via RDP, while simultaneously establishing command and control through fast flux DNS [T1568.001] to mask the true location of their C2 servers behind rapidly changing IP addresses. During the exfiltration phase, the attackers' script extracted sensitive documents, such as `sensitive_docs.zip` from user folders [T1020], and utilized Bluetooth pairing spoofing [T1011.001] to transfer stolen data over unauthorized connections. Finally, for impact, the campaign deployed an encryptor targeting specific paths like `/vmfs/volumes/` using libraries such as rust-crypto 0.2.36 to encrypt data [T1486]. System logs from the fictional 'Global Finance Corp' indicated unusual network traffic spikes and failed login attempts, though these were unrelated to the core attack chain. The company's background includes a recent merger, which may have introduced security gaps, but this information is provided for context only and not directly tied to the techniques.
