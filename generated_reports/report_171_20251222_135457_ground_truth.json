    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to alert organizations about the fictional threat actor 'ShadowMimic', which conducted a multi-phase campaign against a U.S.-based energy company, 'PowerGrid Inc.', between January and March 2024. Initial reconnaissance involved searching GitHub commit histories for internal network diagrams and scraping social media profiles to gather employee details for impersonation. The actors then established a command and control (C2) infrastructure using a free-tier virtual private server from a cloud provider and sent phishing messages posing as Microsoft Teams notifications to compromise corporate social media account credentials. In the execution phase, they deployed a tailored exploit 'custom_exploit.exe' to bypass security controls and distributed modified Teensy USB devices through supply chains to infect systems. Post-exploitation, the malware employed a keylogger that monitored the Windows message loop to record keyboard activity and altered the /etc/xdg/autostart/malicious.desktop configuration to ensure persistence on Linux systems. Additionally, the attacker patched pam_unix.so to accept a master password for authentication bypass and collected system time data to track infection timelines. For lateral movement, the actors used Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections to access other machines and leveraged Google Chrome Remote Desktop for covert remote control. Finally, exfiltration was conducted by posting stolen credentials to a webhook endpoint using HTTP POST requests. System logs from PowerGrid Inc. showed unusual network traffic spikes on port 3389, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured monitoring tools. The company's background includes operations across multiple states, with legacy systems still in use, complicating security updates.",

The campaign involved reconnaissance through public sources, credential theft via social engineering, exploitation of hardware supply chains, and persistent remote access. Blue teams should review logs for suspicious activities related to these techniques to enhance detection and response capabilities.",
