The actors likely conducted reconnaissance to identify key employees, such as IT administrators and financial analysts, before launching the attack.\n\nInitial Access: The adversary sent spearphishing emails containing malicious links disguised as urgent security updates, which, when clicked, redirected victims to a compromised website hosting exploit kits.\n\nExecution: Upon visiting the site, a malicious script executed in the background, leveraging PowerShell to download and deploy a keylogger payload while simultaneously modifying the root crontab file to ensure persistence at system startup.\n\nPersistence: The attacker further established persistence by hijacking the AppDomainManager to load a rogue DLL during application startup, enabling long-term access without user interaction.\n\nDefense Evasion: To obscure their activities, the adversary modified the Windows Event Log to remove evidence of unauthorized access and used a VPN service to mask their command-and-control (C2) communications from network monitoring tools.\n\nCredential Access: The keylogger captured user credentials and session cookies, which the threat actor then used to gain unauthorized access to SecureBank's internal web applications without requiring passwords.\n\nAdditional noise: System logs from SecureBank's firewall indicated intermittent spikes in traffic to cloud storage services, but these were later attributed to a scheduled backup process. The company's background includes a recent merger with a smaller regional bank, which may have introduced integration vulnerabilities, though this was not directly exploited in this scenario.",
