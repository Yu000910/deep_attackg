CRIMSON SHADOW actors likely conduct reconnaissance to identify vulnerable applications in target networks. In one incident, the malicious script executed 'fuzz_tool.exe' to discover input validation weaknesses in a web application [T1587.004], which was then exploited to gain initial access. Upon compromise, the actors deployed njRAT malware, configured to replicate through removable media [T1091] by copying itself to USB drives when inserted, facilitating lateral movement across air-gapped systems. In hybrid cloud environments, the actors leveraged malicious scripts that used Azure RunCommand to execute privilege escalation commands on virtual machines [T1651], while simultaneously employing Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) queries [T1047] to detect virtual machine environments and evade sandboxing. For privilege escalation, the attacker manipulated the SID-History attribute [T1134.005] to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized administrative rights, then dumped cached domain credentials using tdbdump [T1003.005] for lateral movement within the domain. Credential theft was further enhanced through API hooking techniques [T1056.004] to intercept authentication calls, and the actors performed screen captures [T1113] to gather sensitive information from compromised systems. For command and control (C2), the threat actor embedded C2 instructions within SMB write operations [T1071.002] to avoid detection, while also using non-application layer protocols such as TCP and KCP over UDP [T1095] for resilient communication. Data exfiltration involved multiple methods: attackers used Bluetooth pairing spoofing [T1011.001] to establish unauthorized connections and transfer stolen data to nearby devices, and the ransomware component collected file metadata and transmitted it to webhook.site [T1567.004] for analysis. System logs from affected endpoints showed unusual PowerShell activity and failed login attempts, though these were not directly linked to the campaign. The targeted organization, a mid-sized financial services firm with offices in New York and London, reported no significant operational disruption during this simulated exercise.
