The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on the activities of the fictional APT group 'J-magic', which has been observed targeting creative industries such as graphic design and marketing firms. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify high-value targets, though this was not directly observed in this scenario. The campaign began with SEO poisoning [T1608.006], where attackers manipulated search engine rankings by injecting invisible text blocks containing popular keywords like 'free design templates' into compromised websites. This tactic was used to redirect users to malicious domains hosting fake Pinterest boards. The actors then employed spearphishing via service [T1566.003], creating fraudulent Pinterest boards with links that claimed to offer free design resources but instead delivered malicious payloads. Upon user interaction, the payloads were executed using self-signed digital certificates [T1587.003] to establish command and control (C2) infrastructure on virtual private servers (VPS), evading traditional security measures. Once initial access was gained, the malware conducted system owner/user discovery [T1033] to collect usernames and performed system service discovery [T1007] to enumerate services and permissions, aiding in privilege escalation. The actors also executed browser information discovery [T1217], locating Google Chrome folders to harvest browsing history and cookies for credential theft. Additionally, content injection [T1659] was used to insert malicious JavaScript into HTTP responses, enabling cross-site scripting attacks to further compromise user sessions. For lateral movement, the malware replicated through removable media [T1091], modifying drives to use Autorun for execution and hiding legitimate files to spread to air-gapped networks. Finally, the backdoor leveraged shared modules [T1129], allowing remote attackers to load and call DLL functions dynamically for persistent access. Throughout the incident, system logs showed normal network traffic patterns, and the company's background in digital marketing provided no direct correlation to the attack vectors. The campaign resulted in data exfiltration and potential network compromise, highlighting the need for enhanced monitoring of social media and removable device usage.
