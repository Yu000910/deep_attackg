    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide information on a fictional Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaign, 'ShadowHarvest,' observed targeting financial organizations in the United States. This report is for educational purposes to enhance blue team training and preparedness.\n\nBackground: The targeted organization, 'SecureBank Corp,' is a mid-sized financial services company with operations across multiple states. Initial logs from their SIEM indicated unusual network traffic patterns on June 15, 2024, but no immediate alerts were triggered. The company's IT infrastructure includes a mix of on-premises servers and cloud-based applications, with standard security appliances deployed.\n\nAttack Narrative:\n- **Reconnaissance**: The actors conducted initial reconnaissance by scraping the corporate website's team directory page to gather employee names and utilized dig to resolve security appliance hostnames, gathering network details such as firewall and intrusion detection system configurations. This phase lasted approximately two weeks, with low-volume queries that blended into normal traffic.\n- **Initial Access and Execution**: Malware was stored on IPFS using a content hash for decentralized distribution to victims, and it was delivered via spearphishing emails containing malicious links that mimicked legitimate internal communications. Upon execution, the threat actor exploited the built-in Guest account, which had not been disabled on the web server, to gain initial foothold.\n- **Persistence and Credential Access**: The malware employed input injection by monitoring the Windows message loop to intercept password entries without user detection and used msxsl.exe to circumvent application control policies through XSL script processing. Subsequently, it performed credential dumping using modified Quarks PwDump to extract cached domain credentials.\n- **Lateral Movement and Exfiltration**: The actor used Exchange Management Shell to create transport rules forwarding emails containing keywords like 'confidential' for data exfiltration and installed TCP and UDP filters on the eth0 interface to manipulate network traffic. Additionally, Ryuk malware variants were observed using Wake-on-LAN to power on turned-off systems for lateral movement across the network.\n- **Impact**: In the final stage, the malicious payload sent UDP flood packets to cause service degradation through network resource exhaustion, simulating a direct network flood attack. This resulted in temporary disruption of online banking services, with incident response teams noting increased latency and packet loss in network monitoring tools.\n\nMitigation Recommendations: Organizations should disable default accounts, implement application whitelisting, monitor for unusual email forwarding rules, and deploy network segmentation to limit lateral movement. Regular employee training on phishing awareness is also critical.\n\nThis advisory is based on fictional data for training purposes and does not reflect real-world incidents.",
