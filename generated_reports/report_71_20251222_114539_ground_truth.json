    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide awareness and defensive guidance regarding the fictional threat actor group 'ShadowWeaver'. This group, believed to be state-sponsored, has been active since early 2023, focusing on energy and telecommunications sectors in North America and Europe. Initial analysis indicates that the actors likely conduct reconnaissance by gathering passive DNS information to identify potential targets and map network infrastructures. In one incident, logs from a compromised DNS server showed unusual query patterns over a two-week period, though no immediate alerts were triggered due to normal traffic noise. Subsequently, ShadowWeaver compromised the software supply chain by injecting malware into the Able Desktop installer, which was distributed through legitimate update channels, and simultaneously targeted the hardware supply chain by embedding malicious firmware into network routers to establish persistent backdoor access. Once initial access was achieved, the adversary employed system services via svchost.exe to load and execute a remote access trojan DLL while actively manipulating Kerberos tickets using ccache files to forge authentication credentials. During lateral movement, the group conducted network sniffing to intercept plaintext authentication data from VPC traffic and performed system network configuration discovery using tools like ipconfig and tracert to enumerate IP addresses and network settings. To evade detection, ShadowWeaver obfuscated their malware with junk data, making static analysis challenging. Additional irrelevant details include routine system maintenance logs from affected servers showing no anomalies prior to the attack, and background information on the victim companies, which were mid-sized utilities with outdated patch management policies. Defensive recommendations include monitoring for unusual DNS queries, verifying software and hardware integrity, and implementing network segmentation.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by the fictional threat actor group 'ShadowWeaver', which has been observed targeting critical infrastructure sectors through a multi-faceted attack involving supply chain compromises and credential theft. The campaign leverages DNS reconnaissance, malicious software and hardware implants, service exploitation, Kerberos ticket manipulation, network sniffing, and obfuscation techniques to achieve persistence and lateral movement within victim environments. Blue teams are advised to review defensive measures and detection strategies outlined in this report.",
