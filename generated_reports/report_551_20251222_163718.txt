Crimson Serpent, a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has been observed targeting financial organizations in a multi-stage attack campaign. The actors began by gathering victim network information [T1590], performing DNS queries to identify mail server records and other critical infrastructure. Following reconnaissance, they executed a drive-by compromise [T1189] by strategically compromising a legitimate industry news website frequented by target employees, redirecting visitors to malicious domains. Concurrently, the group conducted spearphishing attacks [T1566.002], sending tailored emails with embedded links that directed recipients to download malicious payloads disguised as job offer documents. Upon user execution [T1204], victims enabled content in these documents, triggering the deployment of a custom malware that utilized inter-process communication [T1559] to coordinate with embedded components via shared memory, evading detection. After initial access, the adversary leveraged external remote services [T1133], exploiting a compromised VPN gateway to establish remote access to the corporate network, where they performed credential stuffing [T1110.004] against SSH services using combinations from breached password lists. To escalate privileges, the actors conducted Kerberoasting [T1558.003], querying domain controllers to identify accounts with weak password policies for further exploitation. Subsequently, they engaged in remote system discovery [T1018], using Windows Management Instrumentation to enumerate all systems in the network, mapping out targets for lateral movement. Finally, to bridge air-gapped networks, the malware employed communication through removable media [T1092], writing configuration files to USB drives to facilitate command and control in isolated environments. Throughout the campaign, system logs showed routine network traffic spikes and failed login attempts from IP addresses in Eastern Europe, though these were unrelated to the core attack chain. The organization's background includes a recent merger, which may have increased its attack surface but did not directly influence the techniques used.
