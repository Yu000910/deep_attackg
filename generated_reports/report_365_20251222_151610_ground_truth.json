    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional threat actor, 'Crimson Shadow', observed conducting a sophisticated campaign against cloud and Linux environments. Initial reconnaissance involved inserting malicious scripts into compromised websites to harvest victim software details such as browser type and system language, while simultaneously using nslookup to query subdomains and map the target's CDN infrastructure. The actors developed custom malicious npm packages for payload delivery and exploited stolen service account tokens to gain unauthorized access to cloud accounts. On compromised Windows systems, they employed Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to query anti-virus products and evade detection. In Linux environments, the adversary modified LD_PRELOAD to hijack dynamic linker calls and redirect them to malicious code, while also patching pam_unix.so to create a persistent backdoor through Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). To monitor privilege escalation, they deployed a tool that watched /var/db/sudo for changes in user behavior, and installed TinyPilot on servers to establish persistent remote access via hardware. System logs from the fictional company 'TechGlobal Inc.' showed increased network traffic to unknown CDN endpoints, but no direct financial loss was reported. The company's background includes operations in fintech with a hybrid cloud setup, and irrelevant firewall logs indicated routine SSH connections from authorized IPs.",

The campaign leverages compromised websites, CDN mapping, malicious npm packages, stolen cloud tokens, and various Linux-based techniques for unauthorized access and remote control. Blue teams should review logs for anomalous WMI queries, sudo changes, and LD_PRELOAD modifications to detect similar activities.",
