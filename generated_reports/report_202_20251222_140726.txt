The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign. The actors, known as Disco, have been observed targeting organizations in the financial and technology sectors, with initial access traced to a phishing campaign that led to credential compromise in an AWS environment. System logs from the affected network show unusual DNS queries and HTTP redirects occurring over a 72-hour period prior to detection.

Initial Access & Execution: Disco achieved initial access by conducting content injection into DNS, HTTP, and SMB replies to redirect targeted hosts to download malicious payloads [T1659], which executed upon user interaction to deploy backdoors. The actors then leveraged a compromised AWS account to distribute a backdoored Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with embedded credential harvesting capabilities [T1204.003], allowing for persistent access to cloud resources.

Persistence & Credential Access: To maintain access, the malware employed PowerShell scripts to extract private keys from the Windows certificate store and create forged authentication certificates [T1649], enabling lateral movement and privilege escalation. Additionally, the malware queried Confluence instances for deployment procedures and infrastructure configuration details [T1213.001], aiding in reconnaissance and targeting critical assets.

Command and Control (C2) & Exfiltration: For C2 communications, Nightdoor, a component of the malware, utilized web services such as Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive to receive commands and exfiltrate data [T1102]. Data exfiltration was conducted over alternative protocols using the curl -s -L -o command to transfer archived sensitive information to attacker-controlled URLs [T1048], bypassing traditional network monitoring tools. Network traffic analysis revealed encrypted connections to external domains, though further investigation is ongoing to identify all compromised endpoints.
