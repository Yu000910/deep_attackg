    "clean_text": "On October 15, 2023, SHADOWWEAVER initiated a multi-vector attack against Global Finance Corp (GFC), a fictional multinational bank. The actors first conducted reconnaissance by gathering victim identity information from public sources like LinkedIn and corporate websites. They then sent spearphishing emails with malicious links to track employee interactions and followed up with spearphishing voice calls to extract additional personal data, while simultaneously deploying spearphishing attachments containing malicious Word documents to gain initial access. Once inside, the adversary used AutoHotKey scripts to automate payload execution and establish persistence, while acquiring a botnet of compromised systems for operational relay. For lateral movement, they performed remote system discovery via port scanning and network service discovery, then utilized Remote Desktop Protocol to move across the network, tunneling traffic through an internal proxy and employing DNS calculation techniques to bypass egress filters. During this phase, they also conducted peripheral device discovery to identify connected USB drives and modified domain policies to grant administrative privileges. Finally, the actors manipulated data by injecting malicious DLLs into web browsers to hijack user sessions. System logs from GFC's SIEM showed anomalous login attempts from IP 192.168.1.100 at 03:00 UTC, but these were initially dismissed as false positives. The company's background includes operations in 50 countries with 10,000 employees, though this information is unrelated to the attack vectors.",
