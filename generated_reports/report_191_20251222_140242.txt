On April 15, 2024, a mid-sized financial services company, 'SecureFin Corp.', reported anomalous activity in its hybrid cloud environment, involving unauthorized access and data exfiltration. Initial investigation revealed that the threat actors likely conducted reconnaissance to gather victim identity information [T1589] by sending phishing emails disguised as login notifications, which harvested employee credentials. System logs from the corporate email server showed a spike in failed login attempts from unknown IP addresses, though these were unrelated to the primary attack vector. The actors then used content injection [T1659] to embed a keylogger payload into encrypted network communications, exploiting a vulnerability in the company's VPN software to intercept and modify data in transit. Following this, they executed malicious commands via Launchctl [T1569.001] to replace a legitimate service with a malicious one, using 'launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/legitimate.plist && launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/malicious.plist' to maintain persistence on macOS endpoints. Concurrently, the attackers deployed a malicious image [T1204.003] in the AWS environment, dropping an AMI with embedded credential harvesting tools disguised as legitimate monitoring software, which was then used to modify cloud compute configurations [T1578.005] by changing Google Cloud project quotas to enable higher resource consumption for data exfiltration activities. Background checks on SecureFin's cloud administrators revealed no prior security incidents, but this was irrelevant to the attack. The malware, identified as a variant of MarkiRAT, targeted password managers [T1555.005] to extract credentials from KeePass, while employing log enumeration [T1654] via PowerShell commands to query and filter System logs for suspicious activities, such as failed authentication events. Attackers further exploited Distributed Component Object Model [T1021.003] through Microsoft Excel's DCOM interface to run malicious code on remote machines, and used domain fronting [T1090.004] to manipulate HTTP Referer headers and obfuscate the destination of encrypted web traffic. A scheduled transfer [T1029] was established via a scheduled task running 'malicious.ps1' via PowerShell for periodic data exfiltration, which leveraged exfiltration over unencrypted non-C2 protocol [T1048.003] by generating email messages via SMTP containing information about newly infected victims, mimicking tactics of the Lazarus Group. Finally, the malware executed an OS exhaustion flood [T1499.001] through a SYN flood script targeting specific services to cause resource exhaustion, disrupting operations. Network traffic analysis indicated unusual spikes in outbound SMTP connections, but no correlation was found with legitimate business processes.
