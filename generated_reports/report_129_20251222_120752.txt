On 2024-08-15, a financial services organization reported anomalous network traffic from an internal server. Investigation revealed a multi-stage attack beginning with a drive-by compromise [T1189] via a compromised vendor website, which redirected users to a malicious site that registered custom URL schemes. The initial payload involved a Python-based backdoor compiled with PyInstaller [T1059.006], which was executed to establish persistence. Subsequently, the actors leveraged Windows Management Instrumentation [T1047] for remote code execution, using Impacket's WMIexec module to run VBScript queries and deploy additional tools. The backdoor configured socket parameters via setsockopt to receive trigger packets for command-and-control (C2) communication [T1205.002]. In the cloud environment, the attacker executed 'gcloud compute disks snapshot' to create a snapshot of a compromised disk image [T1578.001], preserving data for later retrieval. To evade detection, verclsid.exe was used to circumvent security controls and launch a payload [T1218.012]. Credential theft activities included stealing Kerberos tickets, where malicious code executed klist with the purge option to clear cached tickets after extraction [T1558], and forging web credentials by using compromised IAM user credentials to invoke AssumeRole for unauthorized resource access [T1606]. Discovery phases involved password policy discovery through PowerShell remoting, running 'Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy' to learn about password history policies [T1201], and system network configuration discovery to gather information on victim IP addresses [T1016]. Data staging occurred locally, with collected data aggregated in a tmp file [T1074.001]. Exfiltration utilized DNS tunneling, encoding C2 data in the labels of DNS queries to a controlled server [T1001.001] while injecting junk data to obscure traffic. The attack culminated in application exploitation, leveraging a zero-day flaw in web server software to create an endless loop of resource allocation requests [T1499.004], causing denial-of-service conditions. Logs from the affected server showed increased CPU usage and failed authentication attempts, though these were unrelated to the core TTPs. The organization's background includes a recent migration to cloud services, which may have introduced misconfigurations exploited in this scenario.
