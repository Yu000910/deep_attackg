**Background**
GlobalTech Industries, a leader in industrial automation with operations across North America and Europe, reported anomalous network activity on October 26, 2024, following a series of failed login attempts from unknown IP addresses. Initial logs from their SIEM indicated unusual outbound traffic patterns, but no immediate impact on production systems was observed.

**Attack Narrative**
Crimson Viper initiated the campaign by conducting reconnaissance on social media platforms, specifically searching YouTube for company event videos that might reveal internal processes [T1593.001]. Concurrently, the malware queried GlobalTech's corporate blog to analyze posting frequency patterns, identifying business tempo and potential vulnerabilities [T1591.003]. Using this intelligence, the actors crafted targeted phishing emails [T1566] that masqueraded as urgent HR updates, employing double file extensions such as .pdf.lnk to evade detection [T1036.007]. Upon execution, the malware leveraged captured local account information, including service accounts, for initial access and persistence [T1078.003]. It then employed PowerShell [T1059.001] to dynamically resolve APIs and encrypt its communication module, preventing network traffic inspection [T1027.007], while querying network connections to verify command and control channels through mutual exclusion checks [T1480.002]. For lateral movement, the adversary used network device CLI to modify routing tables with commands like 'ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.1.1.1' [T1059.008] and executed DCSync attacks to retrieve password hashes from the local security authority [T1003.006]. Additionally, a credential-stealing DLL was written to user profile directories to capture login information [T1556.002]. The malware conducted discovery activities by using commands like 'esxcli network vm list' to identify running VMs and their network configurations [T1673] and collected domain group information by running net group /domain commands [T1069.002]. To obscure communications, it implemented internal proxies like HTRAN to relay traffic within normal network patterns [T1090.001] and leveraged external proxies, including compromised university servers, to hide its origin [T1090.002]. Finally, the campaign included endpoint denial of service attacks to disrupt services temporarily, mimicking tactics used in historical incidents [T1499].

**Irrelevant Information**
GlobalTech's IT department noted increased CPU usage on several servers during off-hours, but this was initially attributed to scheduled maintenance. The company's annual revenue in 2023 was $5.2 billion, with primary facilities located in Chicago and Frankfurt. No customer data was reported compromised in this simulated scenario.
