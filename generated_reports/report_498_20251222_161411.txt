On October 15, 2023, SHADOWWEAVER initiated a multi-vector attack against Global Finance Corp (GFC), a fictional multinational bank. The actors first conducted reconnaissance by gathering victim identity information from public sources like LinkedIn and corporate websites [T1589]. They then sent spearphishing emails with malicious links to track employee interactions [T1598.003] and followed up with spearphishing voice calls to extract additional personal data [T1598.004], while simultaneously deploying spearphishing attachments containing malicious Word documents to gain initial access [T1566.001]. Once inside, the adversary used AutoHotKey scripts [T1059.010] to automate payload execution and establish persistence, while acquiring a botnet of compromised systems for operational relay [T1583.005]. For lateral movement, they performed remote system discovery via port scanning [T1018] and network service discovery [T1046], then utilized Remote Desktop Protocol [T1021.001] to move across the network, tunneling traffic through an internal proxy [T1090.001] and employing DNS calculation techniques to bypass egress filters [T1568.003]. During this phase, they also conducted peripheral device discovery to identify connected USB drives [T1120] and modified domain policies to grant administrative privileges [T1484]. Finally, the actors manipulated data by injecting malicious DLLs into web browsers to hijack user sessions [T1565]. System logs from GFC's SIEM showed anomalous login attempts from IP 192.168.1.100 at 03:00 UTC, but these were initially dismissed as false positives. The company's background includes operations in 50 countries with 10,000 employees, though this information is unrelated to the attack vectors.
