    "clean_text": "On October 15, 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA identified malicious activity attributed to the fictional APT group 'ShadowDNS', targeting a U.S.-based energy company, 'PowerGrid Inc.', with operations across multiple states. Initial analysis suggests the actors likely conducted reconnaissance through open-source intelligence gathering on employee social media profiles and network infrastructure. The attack began with the threat actor injecting a backdoor payload into DNS queries to establish persistent access by exploiting misconfigured DNS servers at PowerGrid Inc., leading to anomalous traffic logs detected by the security team. Subsequently, the adversary employed Lua modules to execute malicious scripts on compromised systems while simultaneously embedding a PowerShell script in PowerPoint's default template to maintain persistence and evade traditional antivirus scans. In a cloud environment, the attacker added Global Administrator permissions to a low-privilege user for persistence in the company's Azure AD, as noted in audit logs showing unusual role assignments. The malware then injected malicious.dll into the explorer.exe process to evade detection and capture credentials by redirecting text-based login codes to websites they controlled, mimicking the Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack. Additionally, the actors utilized Remcos-like capabilities to access a system's webcam and take pictures for potential blackmail or intelligence gathering, with system logs indicating unauthorized camera access on an executive's laptop. For command and control (C2) communication, QakBot was observed using domain generation algorithms to dynamically resolve to new domains, complicating network-based blocking efforts. PowerGrid Inc. reported no operational disruptions, but the incident highlights vulnerabilities in DNS security and endpoint protection.",
