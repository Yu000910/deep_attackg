SilentShade likely conducted reconnaissance by querying DNS to resolve assets.example.com, analyzing CDN usage to map infrastructure [T1596.004]. The actors then created a counterfeit Instagram profile impersonating a bank's official account, gathering customer data through spearphishing services [T1598.001]. In subsequent phases, they sent targeted emails with links to actor-controlled Google Drive documents, leveraging spearphishing links to deliver initial payloads [T1566.002]. Upon compromise, the malware used stolen domain admin accounts to move laterally within the victim domain, accessing sensitive systems [T1078.002]. The adversary employed a compromised developer account to write a Dockerfile with embedded credential harvesting scripts, deploying malicious images to cloud environments [T1204.003]. For execution, the malware utilized thread execution hijacking within legitimate system processes to run payloads covertly [T1055.003], while bypassing security controls by writing disguised executables to user documents with quarantine metadata removed [T1553.001]. System logs from 2023-10-15 show unusual PowerShell activity, but this was unrelated. The actors further leveraged digitally signed Microsoft binaries to load malicious DLLs through system script proxy execution [T1216], and exploited libpcap libraries to capture network packets, identifying covert communication channels via traffic signaling [T1205]. To obfuscate command and control traffic, the malware employed base64 encoding before data transmission, effectively hiding communications [T1001]. Internal investigation noted increased failed login attempts on domain controllers, though these were attributed to misconfigured scripts.
