    "clean_text": "On October 15, 2023, APT-FICT initiated a campaign by compromising the software supply chain of a popular DevOps tool, replacing a legitimate compiled binary with a trojanized version that contained additional malicious payloads. The malware, upon execution, exploited cloud management APIs to establish persistent access to container registries and used the Hypervisor CLI to suppress shell warnings with the command 'esxcli system settings advanced set -o /UserVars/SuppressShellWarning -i 1'. System logs from affected hosts show increased network traffic to external IPs, but these were initially dismissed as false positives. To ensure persistence, the threat actors wrote malicious configuration files to /etc/emond.d/rules/ for automatic execution after reboot while simultaneously modifying ADFS claims rules to include unauthorized attributes in SAML tokens for privilege escalation. The backdoor was programmed to use setsockopt for enabling promiscuous mode on network interfaces and exfiltrated data directly to its C2 domain via HTTP, with modified application.exe showing false system information to users. Incident responders noted anomalous registry entries and failed login attempts from unknown accounts, though these were unrelated to the core attack chain. The company, a mid-sized financial services firm, reported no initial data loss, but subsequent analysis revealed unauthorized access to sensitive customer data stored in cloud storage buckets.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, designated as APT-FICT, targeting organizations through software supply chain compromise and cloud exploitation. The campaign involves trojanized software updates, cloud account abuse, and persistent access mechanisms across hybrid environments. Blue teams are advised to review logs, implement strict supply chain controls, and monitor for the described behaviors.",
