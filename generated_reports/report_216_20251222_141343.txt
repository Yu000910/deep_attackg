The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign. 'Silent Echo' actors likely conducted reconnaissance on target networks, focusing on employees with access to sensitive systems. The campaign began with the adversary using a compromised USB drive to replicate malware [T1091] by altering Autorun.inf to execute a hidden script upon insertion, as observed in system logs from a manufacturing firm's engineering workstation. Following initial access, the actors established persistence by modifying the /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root file to schedule a reverse shell [T1053.003], while simultaneously leveraging compromised Azure credentials for lateral movement to on-premises systems and utilizing pre-existing AWS EC2 instances for data collection [T1021.007]. During lateral movement, the group employed FTP for command and control communications [T1071.002], exfiltrating data through anomalous file transfers logged on a backup server. In the final phase, the actors executed a destructive attack by overwriting the system management mode firmware update mechanism to cause permanent corruption [T1495] and exploited a resource exhaustion vulnerability in a web application framework to trigger endpoint denial of service [T1499], disrupting operations at a utility company. Background noise includes routine network scans from internal IT teams and unrelated failed login attempts from legacy systems.
