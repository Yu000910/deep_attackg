The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign, 'ShadowVeil'. This campaign targets critical infrastructure sectors, such as energy and finance, with the goal of data theft and disruption. Actors likely conduct reconnaissance by gathering employee names [T1589.003] from public sources like LinkedIn and company websites, while simultaneously establishing covert DNS servers [T1583.002] to facilitate command and control. In preparation, they created self-signed code signing certificates [T1587.002] spoofing legitimate software vendors to evade detection. The initial access phase involved a spear-phishing campaign [T1566] that delivered weaponized PDF attachments, which, upon execution, employed PowerShell to download additional payloads. Once on a compromised system, the malware established persistence by leveraging XPC services [T1559.003] to install backdoors and modified system files through path interception [T1574.008] by placing a malicious 'crypt32.dll' in a directory with higher search precedence. To escalate privileges and move laterally, the actors forged SAML tokens [T1606.002] using stolen certificates and conducted cloud service discovery [T1526] by querying the Microsoft Graph API to enumerate Azure AD users and roles. For data exfiltration, they utilized DNS calculation [T1568.003] to encode stolen data in DNS MX record queries, bypassing network filters. The campaign concluded with external defacement [T1491.002], where attackers modified the organization's public-facing homepage to display a ransom note. System logs from the affected environment show routine network traffic spikes at 03:00 UTC, unrelated to the attack, and background company information indicates the target was a mid-sized utility provider with outdated patch management processes.
