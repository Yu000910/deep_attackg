CrimsonTide likely established a Dropbox account using stolen credentials [T1585.003] to facilitate data exfiltration while simultaneously altering local DNS settings [T1584.002] to redirect traffic from banking websites to phishing servers. Initial access was achieved by exploiting a trusted relationship with a contractor [T1199], allowing the actors to pivot into the victim's infrastructure, and they used publicly-accessible RDP and remote management servers [T1133] to gain persistent access to victim machines. Upon entry, the malware employed a malicious JavaScript file that executed a PowerShell payload [T1608.004] when loaded in a victim's browser, and the threat actor stored a JavaScript Blob containing exploit code [T1027.006] to bypass web filters. Execution involved creating Windows services to run encoded PowerShell commands [T1569.002], and CrimsonTide used PowerShell [T1059.001] to download additional payloads like Meterpreter while modifying registry keys. Discovery activities included querying the Docker API to obtain information about mounted volumes [T1613] and using dsquery to gather data on domain trusts [T1482], with system logs showing normal user logins at 08:00 UTC and routine backup processes. Command and control was maintained through bidirectional communication via GitHub [T1102.002], where the group pulled hosted image payloads and committed command execution outputs, and exfiltration was conducted by uploading stolen data to GitHub repositories [T1567.001], with network traffic indicating increased outbound connections to cloud storage IPs during off-hours.
