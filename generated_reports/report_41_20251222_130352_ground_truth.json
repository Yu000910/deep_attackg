    "clean_text": "CrimsonTide actors initiated their campaign by conducting reconnaissance to gather employee credentials through phishing messages distributed via social media. They then modified DNS A records for a corporate login portal to redirect traffic to their phishing server, enabling adversary-in-the-middle attacks to capture additional credentials. Upon gaining initial access, the actors exploited a default Administrator account with the password 'admin123' to move laterally within the network. In a parallel effort, they sent spearphishing emails with links that automatically downloaded and executed a remote access tool when clicked, using Visual Basic scripts to deploy NanoCore malware. The actors further abused Azure Run Command to execute 'net user' commands and create backdoor accounts on virtual machines, while also using CreateProcessWithTokenW to spawn a new explorer.exe process with SYSTEM-level permissions. Through Azure Serial Console, they obtained console-level access to a virtual machine despite firewall restrictions, leveraging remote administration tools for persistent infiltration. The malware collected sensitive documents and prepared them for transmission to webhook.site, and finally, the attacker's script used 'format C:' to completely erase the system partition and disable boot capabilities. System logs from the targeted environment showed routine network traffic spikes unrelated to the attack, and the company's background includes a recent merger that expanded its digital footprint, though this did not directly facilitate the intrusion.",
