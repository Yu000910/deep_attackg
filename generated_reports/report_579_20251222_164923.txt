The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on fictional activity attributed to the threat actor GOLD SOUTHFIELD. This campaign targets organizations in the energy and manufacturing sectors, leveraging a multi-faceted approach to achieve persistence and disruption.

Initial Access: GOLD SOUTHFIELD conducted malicious spam campaigns [T1566] to deliver phishing emails with malicious LNK files that initiated background processes to download credential harvesting tools [T1027.012]. Concurrently, the actor compromised the hardware supply chain by distributing modified Teensy USB devices [T1195.003] to infect consumer electronics, enabling initial footholds in victim networks. System logs from affected devices show unusual USB insertion events, but these were initially overlooked due to high network traffic volumes.

Execution: Upon access, the actor employed PowerShell [T1059.001] to download an exploit kit from http://malicious-site.com/exploit_pack.zip [T1588.005] and designed custom shellcode via 'shellcode_gen.exe' to produce encoded exploits for bypassing defenses [T1587.004]. The malware used regasm.exe to deploy a backdoor by exploiting the trusted utility's execution permissions [T1218.009] and hijacked the AppDomainManager to load a rogue DLL during application startup [T1574.014], ensuring persistence across reboots.

Persistence: To maintain access, the attacker manipulated the UEFI boot order to prioritize loading from a compromised device [T1542.001], while also using PowerShell [T1059.001] to run scripts that collected system information from infected machines [T1102.003] for command and control. Network device CLI commands were executed to modify firewall rules and allow unauthorized inbound connections [T1059.008], as observed in router configuration changes logged at 03:45 UTC.

Lateral Movement: The actor moved laterally within victim environments via SMB using Impacket [T1021.002] and employed an RPC server for peer-to-peer communications to transfer tools and update payloads [T1570], mimicking Stuxnet-like behavior. Internal network scans revealed unusual SMB traffic from compromised workstations to administrative shares, though this was initially attributed to routine maintenance activities.

Collection and Exfiltration: System logs and registry hives were collected via cmd.exe and stored in a hidden folder [T1074.002] for remote data staging, with the actor using one-way communication methods to exfiltrate data without triggering alerts. Application exhaustion floods were executed by exploiting report generation features to request complex reports that maxed out CPU usage [T1499.003], causing service degradation and obscuring other malicious activities. Incident response teams noted CPU spikes up to 95% on critical servers during peak business hours, leading to temporary outages.

This campaign underscores the importance of monitoring for supply chain anomalies, phishing indicators, and unusual network behaviors. Organizations should implement strict access controls, regular firmware updates, and application whitelisting to mitigate these threats.
