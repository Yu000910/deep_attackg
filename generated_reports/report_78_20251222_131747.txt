Background: 'CloudSnare' is assessed to operate with financial motives, leveraging a multi-stage attack chain against global banks. Initial reconnaissance involved monitoring public employee profiles on LinkedIn, though no specific techniques were identified in this phase. The attack began with actors deploying a fake Office 365 login page on a compromised subdomain to harvest user credentials [T1589.001], while simultaneously altering DNS MX records to intercept and monitor email traffic from the target organization [T1584.001]. Following credential theft, the actors exploited a trusted software vendor by replacing a legitimate binary in a software update with a trojanized version that delivered additional payloads [T1195.002]. Once inside the network, the adversary employed AWS Lambda to upload and execute a malicious Python script for serverless code execution [T1648], while renaming 'rundll32.exe' to 'dllhost32.exe' to evade detection by masquerading as a legitimate utility [T1036.003]. To move laterally, the attacker used Pass-the-Hash techniques to authenticate to remote systems without plaintext passwords [T1550], and leveraged Cobalt Strike with domain fronting by manipulating HTTP Host Headers to conceal command and control traffic [T1090.004]. Data exfiltration was orchestrated via PowerShell scripts scheduled to transfer stolen files at regular intervals [T1029], and the campaign concluded with the exploitation of exposed Docker APIs to deploy cryptocurrency mining containers, hijacking cloud compute resources for financial gain [T1496.001]. Logs from affected systems showed increased CPU usage and network anomalies, but these were unrelated to the tagged techniques. The advisory recommends implementing multi-factor authentication, monitoring for unusual DNS changes, and securing cloud APIs to mitigate similar threats.
