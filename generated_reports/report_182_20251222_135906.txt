On March 15, 2024, security teams at GlobalTech Inc. detected anomalous network activity originating from external IP addresses. The company, a technology firm with offices in North America and Europe, reported unusual spikes in ICMP traffic, which were initially dismissed as routine network maintenance. Subsequent analysis revealed a coordinated attack campaign.

Initial Access: The adversary began by conducting reconnaissance to map the victim's network topology using ICMP echo requests [T1595.001]. This scanning activity targeted IP blocks associated with GlobalTech's corporate network and cloud environments, identifying potential entry points. Following this, the threat actor attempted to gain unauthorized access via SSH to an exposed Linux server, exploiting weak credentials in external remote services [T1133].

Execution and Persistence: Upon successful access, the actor employed PowerShell to create hidden scheduled tasks for persistence [T1053.005] while simultaneously exploiting a vulnerable AWS Lambda function to deploy backdoor access in the cloud infrastructure through serverless execution [T1648]. To conceal malicious activities, the adversary allocated a malicious DLL in a remote process using reflective code loading [T1620] and created a new user account named 'supportaccount' to masquerade as legitimate personnel [T1036.010].

Defense Evasion and Collection: Using root privileges, the threat actor cleared system logs in /var/log/messages to erase evidence of their actions [T1070.002]. For data collection, they deployed a JavaScript keylogger on the employee self-service portal to capture credentials [T1056.003], searched for Excel files on removable media using commands like 'where /r E:\ *.xlsx' [T1025], and activated the computer's microphone to capture audio [T1123].

Command and Control and Exfiltration: The malware's command and control infrastructure included hard-coded domains masquerading as legitimate services such as Akamai CDN or Amazon Web Services to hide its infrastructure [T1665]. Finally, the trojan collected sensitive data, including email contacts, and exfiltrated it to a text storage platform for data theft [T1567.003].

Incident response logs from GlobalTech indicated no prior alerts for these activities, highlighting gaps in monitoring. The company's security team has since implemented enhanced logging and network segmentation measures.
