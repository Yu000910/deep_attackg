    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with a realistic training scenario based on fictional APT activity. In this simulated campaign, designated 'Operation Dream Job', actors likely conduct reconnaissance by identifying specific employee roles and business partners through corporate websites, while also searching dark web forums for target information. The initial access phase involved phishing emails containing links to compromised websites that distributed a malicious Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with embedded data exfiltration tools. Upon execution, the adversary employed Azure PowerShell to enumerate virtual machines in the cloud environment and simultaneously extracted password hashes from /etc/shadow. To maintain persistence, the threat actor used certutil -encode to forge authentication certificates and implemented command and control (C2) by mimicking legitimate cloud service API traffic patterns with junk data. Finally, the campaign concluded with stored data manipulation, where malicious scripts modified Access database records to corrupt inventory management information. System logs from the victim environment showed routine HTTP requests to internal servers on port 443, with no anomalies detected prior to the incident. The organization, a mid-sized manufacturing firm, reported no financial impact during this training exercise, but highlighted gaps in cloud security monitoring.",
