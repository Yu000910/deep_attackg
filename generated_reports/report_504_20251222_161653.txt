The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group Cinnamon Tempest. This group has been observed targeting organizations with extensive cloud and virtualized infrastructure, using a blend of open-source tools and social engineering to achieve their objectives.

Background: Cinnamon Tempest is a financially motivated actor believed to operate out of fictional regions, focusing on data exfiltration from high-value targets in the technology and finance sectors. Their campaigns often involve multi-stage attacks that exploit human vulnerabilities and misconfigured cloud services. In this scenario, the attack unfolded over a period of two weeks, with initial detection occurring through anomalous DNS traffic patterns in the victim's network logs. The victim organization, a mid-sized cloud service provider, reported unusual SSH login attempts and unauthorized access to virtual machine management systems, leading to a full investigation that uncovered the detailed kill-chain below.

Kill-Chain Analysis:
- **Initial Access**: The adversary initiated a spearphishing voice call [T1566.004] posing as IT support to trick a user into revealing their system credentials, which were then used to gain initial foothold into the network. System logs from the victim's VoIP server show the call originated from an unverified number, but no further action was taken at that time.
- **Execution**: Upon access, the malware executed 'document.pdf.exe' [T1036.007] when the user double-clicked what appeared to be a PDF file, leveraging a double file extension to evade detection and run malicious code. This triggered the deployment of customized tools including a keylogger that uploads data to Alibaba cloud storage [T1588.002].
- **Persistence**: To maintain access, the adversary altered sshd_config to permit empty passwords [T1098.004], facilitating ongoing SSH access, and simultaneously executed /sbin/emond [T1546.014] to trigger event monitoring and establish persistence on macOS systems within the environment.
- **Privilege Escalation and Discovery**: The malware employed esxcli [T1059.012] to list all running virtual machines and identify high-value targets for further exploitation, while using residential proxies including Azure Virtual Machines [T1586.003] to obfuscate their access to victim environments.
- **Command and Control (C2)**: Cinnamon Tempest used DNS [T1071.004] for C2 communications, blending traffic with legitimate queries to avoid detection, and established a Dropbox account using fabricated credentials [T1585.003] for data exfiltration of stolen information.

Mitigation Recommendations: Organizations should implement multi-factor authentication, monitor for unusual SSH and DNS activity, and train employees on social engineering threats. Regular audits of cloud account configurations and virtual machine management tools are also advised to prevent similar incidents.
