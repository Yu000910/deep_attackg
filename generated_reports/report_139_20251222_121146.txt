The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on a fictional APT campaign targeting a critical infrastructure organization, referred to as 'InfraCorp', which operates in the energy sector. InfraCorp reported anomalous network activity after deploying a routine software update, leading to the discovery of a multi-stage intrusion. Initial analysis indicates the actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify vulnerable systems and personnel. The attack began with the compromise of a third-party PowerShell script repository, where malicious code was injected into 'update.ps1' to exfiltrate sensitive database credentials [T1195.001]. This script was then distributed through automated update mechanisms, allowing the adversary to gain initial access. Once inside, the actors used stolen credentials obtained from a spearphishing campaign to authenticate to the network via VPN and access shared resources [T1078], while simultaneously scheduling a malicious container deployment using Kubernetes CronJob with elevated privileges to establish persistence and execute further payloads [T1053.007]. To maintain access, they modified the Windows Time service provider registry by writing a new subkey [T1547.003] and encrypted file copies to the organization's shared storage location to taint content and disrupt operations [T1080]. For lateral movement and evasion, the malware invoked Connect-AZAccount to authenticate and access Azure virtual machines as the compromised user [T1021.007], established a covert channel using raw sockets to bypass firewall detection through port knocking [T1205.001], and transmitted collected system information using plain HTTP without encryption for exfiltration [T1048.003]. Additionally, the backdoor utilized a secondary cellular connection to exfiltrate database records without using the corporate network [T1011]. Logs from InfraCorp's SIEM showed multiple failed login attempts from unusual IP addresses, but these were initially dismissed as noise. The company's background includes a recent merger with a smaller utility provider, which may have introduced integration vulnerabilities. Further investigation revealed that the actors targeted specific employees with access to financial systems, though no direct financial loss has been confirmed in this training scenario.
