    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign. ShadowVeil actors likely initiated reconnaissance by querying nameservers to map the target's DNS hierarchy and using nmap with service detection to gather information about installed software. Concurrently, they modified social media profiles to enhance persona legitimacy and queried commercial vulnerability databases for exploitable weaknesses. In the initial access phase, the actors exploited compromised Azure Managed Identities to persistently access cloud databases. Upon execution, the malware leveraged Dynamic Data Exchange auto-linking to download and execute payloads from remote servers while intercepting SMS-based one-time passwords and using cloned websites to capture MFA tokens. For persistence and privilege escalation, the actors employed WMIC to query useraccount details for administrative privileges, performed pass the hash attacks, and used stolen authentication tokens to query administrative REST APIs. System logs from the affected environment showed routine backup activities, but no anomalies were flagged initially. The malware then initiated continuous image capture via the system's camera hardware and established covert command and control channels using SSH tunnels to bypass firewall restrictions. For exfiltration, the actors used a customized PlugX variant to transfer documents from air-gapped networks over USB. The target organization, a mid-sized fintech company, reported no financial losses, but the incident highlighted gaps in cloud security monitoring.",
