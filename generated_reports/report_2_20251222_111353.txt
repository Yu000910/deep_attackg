The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on the activities of the advanced persistent threat (APT) group 'Crimson Shadow,' which has been observed targeting financial organizations in North America and Europe since early 2024. Crimson Shadow, believed to operate with state-sponsored backing, employs sophisticated techniques to infiltrate networks, steal sensitive data, and disrupt operations. This report is based on fictional incident response data from a mid-sized bank, 'SecureTrust Financial,' which reported anomalous network traffic and unauthorized access alerts in March 2024, leading to the discovery of a compromised server hosting customer transaction logs. Initial analysis revealed that the actors likely conducted reconnaissance by querying DNS AXFR to obtain a complete list of hosts in the domain [T1590.002] and gathered specific employee identities from social media and corporate directories to tailor phishing campaigns [T1589]. The attack began with a spear-phishing email containing a malicious attachment that, when opened, executed a JavaScript payload [T1059.007] to download and run 'payload_gen.exe,' which created a tailored exploit for a remote code execution flaw in an outdated web application [T1587.004]. Once initial access was achieved, the adversary employed a UAC bypass by manipulating the fodhelper.exe registry key to launch elevated commands [T1548] and used a customized PlugX variant that could spread through USB connections to infect air-gapped systems [T1091]. For lateral movement, the actors collected authentication tokens from browser local storage to circumvent multi-factor authentication [T1550.004] and relayed encrypted communications through a rented virtual private server to mask their location [T1090.003]. During exfiltration, the malware posted stolen financial information to https://webhook.site/endpoint using base64 encoding [T1567.004], and in the final stage, the threat actor employed disk-wiping malware that formatted the EFI system partition to disrupt system startup and cover tracks [T1561.002]. SecureTrust Financial's security team noted increased CPU usage on several servers and unusual outbound traffic to unknown IP addresses, but no actual data loss occurred in this training scenario. The bank's incident response plan was activated, involving isolation of affected systems and forensic analysis, which identified the techniques used. This advisory emphasizes the importance of patching vulnerabilities, monitoring DNS queries, and implementing robust endpoint detection to mitigate similar threats.
