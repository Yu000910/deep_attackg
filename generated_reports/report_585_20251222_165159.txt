The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional APT campaign for training purposes. SHADOW SERPENT actors likely conducted reconnaissance by collecting organizational intelligence from a paid dark web monitoring service [T1597]. Initial access was achieved through a compromised hardware supply chain, where the attacker programmed a Teensy device to automatically run PowerShell scripts for lateral movement [T1195.003]. Upon execution, the adversary employed Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) field codes in a crafted document to run system commands on the target machine [T1559.002] while simultaneously using klist.exe to identify cached TGT tickets for potential extraction [T1558]. System logs from the victim environment show routine backups at 02:00 UTC, but no anomalies were flagged during this phase. For persistence and discovery, the actors utilized Pacu to enumerate IAM users, roles, and groups in cloud accounts [T1087.004], and data staging involved using 'bash -c 'find /home -name *.pdf > /tmp/staged_files.txt'' to collect PDF documents into a staging file [T1074] with RawPOS placing captured data in a temporary file under a directory named 'memdump' [T1074.001]. The company, a mid-sized energy provider, reported normal network traffic patterns, though internal audits noted minor configuration drifts. Command and control was established using DNS for communications [T1071.004] over non-standard ports, with WellMail observed using TCP port 25 without SMTP to leverage an open port for secure command and control [T1571]. Finally, exfiltration occurred over existing command and control channels, as Leviathan exfiltrated collected data during simulated intrusions [T1041]. Network monitoring tools detected unusual DNS queries but were initially dismissed as false positives.
