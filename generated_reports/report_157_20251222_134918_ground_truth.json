    "clean_text": "APT-Zeta likely initiated the campaign by compromising the software supply chain, injecting malicious code into an open-source library's GitHub repository, which was later compiled into production builds at victim organizations. Concurrently, the actors sent phishing emails disguised as cloud service notifications to harvest employee credentials, targeting accounts with access to cloud environments. Upon initial access, APT-Zeta used legitimate local admin account credentials to move laterally within on-premises networks, where they established persistence by creating a Systemd service configured with `WantedBy=multi-user.target` to ensure execution at system startup. In cloud environments, the actors deployed serverless execution by creating a rogue Lambda function with a backdoor for unauthorized command execution. To maintain stealth, APT-Zeta employed steganography to conceal command-and-control (C2) communications within seemingly innocent image files, while using a multi-hop proxy with up to 255 hops to obscure network traffic. For credential theft, the adversaries exfiltrated Ccache files, such as krb5cc_1001, from compromised hosts to impersonate domain users. Additionally, they installed a digital certificate by modifying web server configurations to load a malicious SSL certificate from /var/tmp/fake_cert.pem, facilitating adversary-in-the-middle attacks through DNS cache poisoning to redirect traffic to phishing sites. For data exfiltration, APT-Zeta scheduled malicious code via cron jobs to periodically send sensitive data from systems. In disruptive phases, the actors executed disk structure wipes using tools like diskpart to clean primary partitions, effectively destroying system files. Logs from affected systems show routine errors in application services, unrelated to the attack, such as 'Failed to connect to database at 10.0.0.5' and 'User session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity.' Background on victim organizations includes a mid-sized tech firm with hybrid cloud infrastructure and an energy provider using legacy systems, though these details are not directly linked to the techniques used.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, designated as APT-Zeta, targeting organizations in the technology and energy sectors. The campaign involves a multi-faceted attack leveraging supply chain compromise, credential harvesting, and persistence mechanisms across cloud and on-premises environments. Based on analysis of simulated incidents between January and March 2024, APT-Zeta demonstrates sophisticated capabilities aimed at data exfiltration and disruption. This report is intended for blue team training to enhance detection and response strategies.",
