CrimsonVector, a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has been observed conducting a sophisticated cyber campaign against various sectors, including finance and technology. The attack begins with reconnaissance, where the actors use nmap to scan for network security appliances [T1590.006], identifying VPN gateway services to map potential entry points. Following this, they compromise the software supply chain by tampering with the Able Desktop installer [T1195.002], which is distributed to victims, allowing initial access. Once inside, the adversary employs compiled Python scripts [T1059.006] to execute malicious code, which includes using native API calls such as VirtualAlloc and GetProcAddress [T1106] to allocate memory and load libraries for stealthy operations. To establish persistence, CrimsonVector uses a custom tool to rewrite the system firmware [T1542.001], embedding a malicious payload in the BIOS to survive reboots. For credential access, they exploit MS14-068 to forge Kerberos tickets [T1212], enabling privilege escalation and lateral movement. The malware conducts evasion checks by searching for 'malware.exe' in task manager [T1497.002] to detect virtualized environments and avoid analysis. It also performs discovery by searching for Google Chrome installation paths [T1217] to harvest browsing history and queries Confluence repositories [T1213] to extract stored API credentials from documentation. For credential harvesting, PowerShell is utilized to create deceptive GUI prompts [T1056.002], such as fake Wi-Fi authentication dialogs, to capture user login details. The malware leverages libpcap libraries to capture network packets [T1205], analyzing traffic patterns to signal covert port openings for communication. Data exfiltration is achieved through web services [T1567], where malicious scripts collect system configuration files and network shares, and via traffic duplication using ROMMONkit [T1020.001] to mirror data over covert channels. Additionally, a network sniffer is deployed to manipulate transmitted data [T1565.002], capturing unencrypted database queries containing customer personally identifiable information (PII) for exfiltration. Throughout the campaign, CrimsonVector maintains operational security by blending malicious activities with normal network traffic, as observed in system logs showing anomalous spikes during off-hours, though these logs are not directly tied to specific techniques. The group's infrastructure includes compromised servers in cloud environments, with no attribution to real-world entities in this fictional scenario. Organizations should implement monitoring for these TTPs to enhance detection capabilities.
