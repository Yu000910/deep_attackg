    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign observed in simulated environments. HiveMind actors likely conduct reconnaissance through open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering, though no specific techniques are tagged here. In Operation Honeybee, the threat actors stole a digital signature from Adobe Systems to sign their MaoCheng dropper, enabling execution without triggering security alerts. Initial access was achieved via a spear-phishing campaign, with actors altering MX records on a compromised DNS server to intercept email authentication traffic and harvest credentials, which were then used to exploit cloud APIs, creating backdoor access to virtual machine instances while simultaneously accessing Windows Credential Manager to harvest locally cached credentials for lateral movement. System logs from the victim's on-premises server showed unusual PowerShell activity at 03:00 UTC, unrelated to the attack. For persistence, the actors configured a malicious CronJob in a Kubernetes cluster to execute a data exfiltration container during off-peak hours and installed a rogue DLL as an ISAPI filter on the web server to maintain access. The malware then performed an S3 ListObjectsV2 call to catalog files within a compromised bucket, using a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) to generate URLs for command and control (C2) communication. Through API calls, the attacker configured lifecycle rules that trigger object deletion within hours of creation and abused AWS SNS to broadcast millions of notifications, consuming the service's capacity and causing availability issues. The company, a mid-sized fintech firm, reported no financial loss in this training scenario, but incident response teams noted increased network latency during the simulation.",

The campaign leverages stolen digital certificates, cloud and local account compromise, and container orchestration to achieve persistence, data exfiltration, and disruption. Blue teams should use this report for training to identify and mitigate similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).",
