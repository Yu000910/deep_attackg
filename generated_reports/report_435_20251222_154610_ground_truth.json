    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the fictional threat actor 'Sandstorm Serpent' in a recent simulated campaign against financial organizations. The campaign began with the adversary conducting reconnaissance by searching open professional networking sites to map the organizational structure of the target. Following this, they gathered victim identity information through a spear-phishing email with a fake login page designed to harvest authentication credentials. To support their operations, the actors leased servers from resellers instead of directly from hosting companies, enabling infrastructure setup, and they poisoned search engine results to distribute fake software updates, facilitating malware delivery. The adversary obtained capabilities by downloading a keylogger from a criminal hosting service, which they then injected into encrypted network communications using content injection techniques. For execution, they employed Python scripts and Lua scripts to run malicious payloads on compromised systems. To evade detection, the actors established an SSH tunnel for protocol tunneling to bypass corporate firewall restrictions and exfiltrate data, while also using steganography to inject command and control traffic into image files, blending malicious communications with legitimate network traffic. System logs from the target environment showed routine network activity, including standard HTTP requests and database queries, which were unrelated to the attack. The organization, a mid-sized bank with operations in North America, reported no prior incidents of this nature, but internal security teams noted anomalous login attempts during the campaign period. Analysis of network traffic revealed encrypted packets matching known adversary patterns, though initial alerts were dismissed as false positives due to high network volume. The campaign underscores the importance of monitoring for multi-vector attacks and implementing layered defenses.",
