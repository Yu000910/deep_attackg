APT_ECHO likely initiated their campaign by conducting passive reconnaissance using DNS feeds to map target infrastructure and identify potential entry points, correlating domain activity to uncover related systems [T1590.002]. Following this, the actors sent spearphishing emails via the legitimate service Constant Contact, mimicking internal communications to trick employees into clicking malicious links [T1566.003]. Upon execution, embedded JavaScript payloads in the emails triggered code execution to download additional malware, leveraging browser vulnerabilities for initial foothold [T1059.007]. Once inside the network, APT_ECHO used PowerShell scripts to manipulate Active Directory settings, specifically executing Set-ADUser commands to enable reversible encryption for password storage, facilitating credential harvesting [T1556.005]. To maintain stealth, the group employed steganography tools to hide command and control (C2) traffic within seemingly benign image files, evading network-based detection while exfiltrating data [T1001.002]. Additionally, they utilized dynamic DNS resolution by re-registering previously dormant ClouDNS subdomains, dynamically updating C2 infrastructure to avoid blacklisting and maintain persistence [T1568]. Throughout the attack, system logs showed normal user activity with intermittent spikes in DNS queries, and background checks revealed APT_ECHO has historically targeted sectors with high-value data, though this specific campaign remains fictional for training. Blue teams should monitor for anomalous PowerShell usage, unexpected DNS changes, and suspicious image file transfers to detect similar tactics.
