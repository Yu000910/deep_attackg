The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign, designated 'Nightshade'. This scenario is based on observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in real-world incidents but is entirely fabricated for educational purposes. Nightshade actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] on financial targets, though this phase is not detailed in the scenario. The campaign begins with Initial Access, where the adversary sent spearphishing emails [T1598.003] disguised as password reset requests, containing malicious links to compromised web servers [T1584.004] used for command and control (C2). To enhance access, they acquired pre-compromised VPN credentials [T1650] from an access broker network, enabling lateral movement. During Execution, the malware employed PowerShell [T1059.001] to download payloads [T1105] and replicate through removable media [T1091] for propagation across air-gapped systems. For Persistence, the actors created scheduled tasks [T1053.005] and implemented event-triggered execution [T1546] through COM hijacking, while also modifying /etc/ld.so.preload [T1574.006] to hijack dynamic linker functions and obscure behavior via dynamic API resolution [T1027.007] using GetProcAddress. In Defense Evasion, they used double file extensions [T1036.007] to masquerade malicious LNK files as PDF objects and cleared persistence traces [T1070.009] by removing IFEO registry values. For Command and Control, C2 traffic was encoded with Base64 [T1132.001] to evade detection. During Exfiltration, sensitive documents were collected and sent via unencrypted HTTP requests [T1048.003] to remote servers. Finally, for Impact, the actors issued commands to stop critical services [T1489] on compromised hosts, disrupting operations. Logs from affected systems show routine network traffic and user login attempts, but no direct correlation to the attack. Company background: The targeted entity is a mid-sized bank with outdated security protocols, though this information is irrelevant to the TTPs. This report serves as a training tool to enhance defensive capabilities against similar real-world threats.
