On October 15, 2023, GlobalTech Inc., a technology firm with operations in North America and Europe, reported suspicious activity across its network. Initial analysis revealed that the threat actor, 'Silent Echo', likely conducted reconnaissance [T1598.004] by exploiting a vulnerable VoIP system to intercept executive meetings, gaining insights into internal processes. The attack began with the adversary sending a phishing email [T1566] disguised as an invoice to an employee in the finance department, which included a malicious attachment [T1598.002] named 'SecurityCheck.ps1', a credential-harvesting PowerShell script. Upon execution, this script facilitated initial access [T1650] by deploying a web shell on a vulnerable web server, allowing persistent control. Concurrently, the actor used a compromised USB-to-Ethernet adapter [T1195.003] to perform network reconnaissance when connected, mapping internal systems. Once inside, the threat actor employed AppleScript [T1059.002] to modify system firewall rules and utilized SQL stored procedures [T1505.001] via xp_cmdshell to download and execute additional payloads from a remote server. To expand their foothold, the group conducted internal spearphishing [T1534] from within the compromised network, targeting other employees with tailored messages. Keylogging [T1056.001] was implemented through a tool similar to PoisonIvy, capturing sensitive credentials. Data exfiltration occurred over non-standard ports [T1571], such as TCP 8080, with files being transferred to cloud storage [T1567.002] using Rclone commands. Finally, as a destructive measure, the attackers exploited the ADMIN$ share to deploy a disk wipe payload [T1561], corrupting system files. Logs from GlobalTech's SIEM showed unusual outbound traffic patterns, but no prior alerts were triggered for the VoIP compromise.
