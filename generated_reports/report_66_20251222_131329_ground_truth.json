    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform organizations about a fictional APT campaign, 'ShadowLink', observed targeting corporate networks. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance on public Wi-Fi networks in business districts, exploiting open access points to gain initial footholds on employee devices. Once access was established, the malware invoked the MMDeviceEnumerator COM interface to load and execute malicious payloads while simultaneously using bind mounts to overlay '/proc/2345/fd' with empty directories, hiding its open file descriptors. System logs from affected hosts showed unusual PowerShell activity, where scripts ran commands like 'net group \"Domain Admins\" /domain' to discover administrative group members and employed tools such as ENUM4LINUX for gathering system information on Windows and Samba hosts. For command and control (C2), the backdoor connected to an IRC server using application layer protocols, and during exfiltration, attackers utilized Bluetooth protocol weaknesses to transfer stolen credentials to nearby devices while also establishing encrypted tunnels with OpenSSL for data exfiltration over asymmetric encrypted non-C2 protocols. The campaign's infrastructure included compromised routers and cloud servers, with no evidence of data destruction. Blue teams should monitor for abnormal network traffic and unauthorized access attempts.",

The campaign involves initial access via exploited access points, execution of malicious payloads using COM interfaces, evasion techniques via bind mounts, discovery of system and permission information, and exfiltration over encrypted non-C2 protocols. This report is intended for blue team training to enhance detection and response capabilities.",
