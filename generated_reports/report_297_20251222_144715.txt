The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on the activities of the fictional threat actor 'ShadowDragon', which has been observed targeting U.S. energy companies since early 2024. This report is based on simulated incident response data for training purposes.

Background: 'ShadowDragon' is a state-sponsored group with ties to fictional regions, known for its sophisticated cyber operations against critical infrastructure. The group's tactics include social engineering and persistence mechanisms. In this scenario, the actor targeted 'PowerGrid Inc.', a mid-sized utility provider with operations across the Midwest. Initial alerts were triggered by anomalous network traffic patterns detected by the company's SIEM system, which logged multiple failed login attempts from unrecognized IP addresses in Eastern Europe.

Attack Narrative:
1. Initial Access: The actors conducted reconnaissance by querying public sources such as company press releases and social media profiles to collect employee names [T1589.003], which were then used to craft targeted phishing emails. These emails, disguised as routine security updates from IT support, were distributed to key personnel, including system administrators and executives. The phishing campaign involved emails with attached password-protected ZIP files containing malware, exploiting human error to gain initial footholds [T1566].
2. Execution: Upon execution, the malware employed a keylogger that monitored WM_KEYDOWN messages in the Windows message loop to record all typed characters [T1674], capturing credentials and sensitive data. This was complemented by the creation of local accounts on victim systems, including administrator accounts tailored to specific staging targets [T1136.001], to maintain persistence and evade detection.
3. Persistence: To further entrench access, the adversary altered the SAM database to modify password hashes for existing user accounts [T1556], ensuring continued control even after password changes. Additionally, the malware queried DNS records to establish a covert tunnel for data exfiltration [T1568], enabling the stealthy transfer of stolen information to external command-and-control servers.

Irrelevant Information: During the investigation, analysts noted unrelated system logs showing routine backup failures and minor network latency issues, which were later attributed to scheduled maintenance. 'PowerGrid Inc.' has a history of compliance with NIST standards, and their incident response team conducted a tabletop exercise last quarter, though this did not prevent the simulated breach. The company's CEO issued a statement emphasizing commitment to cybersecurity improvements.

Recommendations: Blue teams should implement multi-factor authentication, monitor for unusual account creation, and conduct regular phishing simulations. This advisory serves as a training tool to enhance defensive capabilities against similar tactics in real-world scenarios.
