On March 15, 2024, a financial institution reported anomalous network traffic from its development environment. Investigation revealed that the threat actor, operating under the moniker 'ShadowBanker', likely conducted reconnaissance through underground forums to acquire a banking trojan [T1588.001] and injected C2 server IP addresses into its configuration to establish a botnet [T1584.005]. The initial access was achieved by compromising a software dependency, where the attacker replaced the legitimate utils.dll with a trojanized version in a widely used open-source library [T1195.001]. This allowed execution via an external remote service, specifically an open Docker daemon API on an Ubuntu container, which deployed the Kinsing malware [T1133]. Once inside, the actors employed Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) [T1047] to modify administrative settings on local and remote hosts for lateral movement, while using WMI Provider Host (wmiprvse.exe) to execute encoded PowerShell scripts via the DownloadString method. For persistence, the attacker replaced the legitimate .config file with a modified version that referenced a malicious DLL, leveraging AppDomainManager injection [T1574.014]. C2 communications were conducted using DNS requests over UDP port 53 [T1071.004], with the backdoor employing modified Base64 encoding that reversed the standard character set to obfuscate traffic [T1132.002]. System logs from the affected host showed increased CPU usage and unusual outbound connections to IP addresses in Eastern Europe, though these were not directly linked to the techniques. The company, a mid-sized bank with operations in North America, reported no financial loss but significant downtime during remediation.
