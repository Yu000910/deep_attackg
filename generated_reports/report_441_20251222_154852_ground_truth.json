    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign. This report is based on a simulated incident at LogiCorp, a mid-sized logistics firm with operations across North America, which experienced a breach in early 2024. Initial investigation revealed that the actors, CrimsonVortex, likely conducted reconnaissance on LogiCorp's public-facing web applications, identifying and exploiting a known vulnerability in an outdated content management system to gain initial access. Once inside, they deployed a custom remote access Trojan (RAT), derived from open-source malware variants, which was hosted on dedicated virtual private servers (VPS) in a foreign jurisdiction to evade detection. The malware then abused Azure Managed Identities to persistently access cloud storage accounts without requiring explicit credentials, while using Visual Basic scripts to execute malicious code and Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to remotely command systems and move laterally within the network. For command and control, the actors leveraged a web service, specifically a Discord channel, to download additional payloads and receive instructions. Finally, they exfiltrated sensitive data, including customer records and internal documents, over the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol to an external server. LogiCorp's security team noted anomalous DNS queries to domains associated with gaming platforms, which were later determined to be false positives from employee activities, and system logs showed routine maintenance alerts on servers that were patched prior to the incident, though these details are not directly related to the attack chain.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by a fictional threat actor, designated as 'CrimsonVortex', targeting organizations in the energy and transportation sectors. Based on analysis of a recent incident at a fictional U.S.-based logistics company, 'LogiCorp', the actors exploited known vulnerabilities [T1588.006] to deploy custom malware [T1588.001] hosted on adversary-controlled virtual private servers [T1583.003]. The campaign involved abusing cloud accounts [T1078.004] for persistence, using Visual Basic scripts [T1059.005] and Windows Remote Management [T1021.006] for execution and lateral movement, leveraging web services [T1102] for command and control, and exfiltrating data over alternative protocols [T1048]. LogiCorp reported unusual network traffic from IP addresses in Eastern Europe, with internal logs showing failed login attempts from legacy systems that were decommissioned last quarter, though these are unrelated to the primary attack vector.",
