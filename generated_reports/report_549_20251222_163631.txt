On October 15, 2023, a fictional manufacturing company, 'TechGlobal Inc.', reported anomalous activity in its network, initially detected through increased USB drive usage logs on Windows endpoints. The company, which operates a mix of Windows servers, Linux-based IoT controllers, and cloud services via Entra ID, had no prior significant security incidents. Background investigation revealed that an employee inadvertently inserted an infected USB drive into a workstation, triggering the attack sequence.

The actors likely conducted initial reconnaissance by scanning for removable media paths [T1091], then employed Python scripts [T1059.006] to enumerate system details and network configurations while simultaneously using Unix shell commands [T1059.004] to establish persistence on Linux servers via SSH. System logs from a Linux router showed unauthorized modifications to the /bin/busybox binary [T1601], which disabled security logging features. Concurrently, the malware altered Entra ID conditional access policies [T1556.009] to bypass device compliance checks, and injected malicious DLLs with hardcoded credentials [T1556.004] to authenticate to network devices. The adversary utilized the same infected USB drive [T1092] to write operational commands for manual execution on air-gapped systems, and exfiltrated stolen credentials by posting them to a webhook endpoint [T1567.004] using automated scripts. Irrelevant logs included routine backup failures on a separate server unrelated to the incident.
