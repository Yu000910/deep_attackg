Crimson Shadow, a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has been observed targeting financial organizations in North America since early 2024. The campaign begins with the actors distributing a trojanized version of PuTTY software via a compromised third-party download site, exploiting the software supply chain to gain initial access [T1195.002]. Upon installation, victims receive phishing emails containing links that display a fabricated 'Adobe Flash Player Update Required' popup; when users click 'Update', malicious commands are executed through copy-and-paste actions, bypassing traditional security measures [T1204.004]. The actors then use compromised credentials obtained from previous breaches to log into internal systems, leveraging valid accounts to move laterally across the network [T1078]. To maintain stealth, they employ PowerShell with the WindowStyle parameter set to hidden, concealing execution windows from users and administrators [T1564.003]. As part of persistence cleanup, the group deletes any temporary accounts created during the attack to remove traces of their presence [T1070.009]. For data collection, the malware exploits libpcap libraries to capture network traffic and hide malicious communication ports, implementing traffic signaling to evade network monitoring [T1205]. Exfiltration occurs through multiple protocols: financial records are first moved using the Net/SMB protocol over port 445 [T1048], and then sensitive data is transferred via FTP in an unencrypted manner to external servers [T1048.003]. In a diversionary tactic, the actors leverage NTP servers with monlist enabled to reflect and amplify traffic toward the organization's IP, potentially overwhelming defenses and masking exfiltration activities [T1498.002]. Logs from affected systems show increased FTP connections during off-hours, but no unusual user activity was flagged by standard monitoring tools. The targeted organizations, including a mid-sized bank in the Midwest, reported no initial signs of compromise, highlighting the need for enhanced blue team training on these techniques.
