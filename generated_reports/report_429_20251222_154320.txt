The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on a fictional APT campaign, 'CookieCrumble', observed in a simulated environment targeting software supply chains. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance to identify vulnerable development tools and dependencies, though no specific logs confirm this activity. In the initial access phase, the adversary compromised a software update mechanism by injecting malicious code into update.ps1, a PowerShell script used for routine software patches, to steal browser cookies and session data [T1195.001]. Upon execution, the malicious update.ps1 script leveraged Visual Basic (VBS) scripts [T1059.005] to load and execute a malicious DLL from a remote server while simultaneously modifying system registry keys to establish persistence. For persistence, the attacker modified the defaults command to launch a malicious executable from a temporary directory at user logon, ensuring the payload runs automatically upon system startup [T1037.002]. During the exploitation phase, the adversary employed XSL script processing [T1220] to download a Base64-encoded DLL custom downloader from a controlled server, which was then decoded and executed in memory to avoid disk-based detection. System logs from the compromised host show increased network traffic to unknown IP addresses, but this was initially overlooked by IT staff. To escalate privileges, the attacker executed mimikatz.exe to dump password hashes from the LSASS process memory [T1110.002], enabling lateral movement within the network. For C2 communication, the malware used publish/subscribe protocols [T1071.005], specifically the Jabber/XMPP protocol, to communicate with servers operated by Google, blending in with legitimate traffic to evade network monitoring. The campaign resulted in the exfiltration of sensitive session data and credentials, with no real-world impact as this is a training scenario. Blue teams should monitor for anomalous script executions, unusual registry modifications, and unexpected network connections to mitigate similar threats.
