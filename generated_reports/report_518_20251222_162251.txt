The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on a fictional threat actor designated as 'Crimson Lazarus', which has been observed conducting a sophisticated campaign against organizations in the financial and technology sectors. This actor likely conducts reconnaissance [T1589] to identify high-value targets, such as system administrators managing virtual infrastructure. Initial access was achieved through spearphishing emails containing malicious links [T1566.002] that, when clicked, redirected victims to compromised websites hosting downloaders. Once initial foothold was established, the actor employed PowerShell [T1059.001] to download additional payloads [T1105] and modify registry keys [T1112] for persistence. The campaign then involved lateral movement by infecting removable media [T1091] to spread across air-gapped systems, while simultaneously using the vSphere Web Services SDK to execute arbitrary commands on compromised guest VMs [T1675] and creating malicious .msc files [T1218.014] to execute payloads when opened by administrators. To maintain stealth, the actor utilized fast flux DNS [T1568.001] by registering new DNS A records for domains like 'update.example.com' to establish covert command and control channels, and employed file deletion [T1070.004] to remove traces of malicious activities, such as log files and temporary scripts. Exfiltration was conducted over alternative protocols, with the actor using FTP [T1048] to transfer stolen credentials and sensitive data from the victim's network to external servers. System logs from affected ESXi hosts showed unusual spikes in CPU usage during off-hours, and network traffic analysis revealed anomalous connections to IP addresses associated with known malicious infrastructure. The company background includes a mid-sized cloud service provider with hybrid VMware environments, where administrators routinely use removable drives for data transfers between segmented networks. This advisory is based on simulated incidents and is intended for training purposes only; any resemblance to real events is coincidental.
