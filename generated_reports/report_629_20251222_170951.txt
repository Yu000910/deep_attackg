The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a simulated APT campaign designated as BOLDMOVE, targeting financial organizations. This report is based on fictional intelligence for educational purposes.

Attack Narrative:
Initial Access: The actors conducted reconnaissance to identify vulnerable infrastructure, then exploited CVE-2022-49475 in FortiOS [T1190] to gain initial access to a target network. System logs from the affected firewall show unusual traffic patterns at 03:45 UTC on 2024-07-15, but no immediate alerts were triggered.

Execution: Upon entry, the adversary employed AutoIt scripts [T1059.010] embedded in malicious documents to execute initial payloads while simultaneously scanning for and automatically connecting to open Wi-Fi networks [T1669] to establish additional footholds. The target organization, a mid-sized bank with operations in North America, reported no prior incidents of this nature.

Persistence: To maintain access, the malware used Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event subscriptions [T1546.003] for persistence and modified network device authentication mechanisms [T1556.004] by embedding hardcoded passwords into the operating system image. Routine network scans conducted by IT staff did not detect these modifications initially.

Command and Control (C2): The backdoor established multi-stage channels [T1104] by running 'remote_access_tool.exe' to manage multiple C2 connections, with C2 payloads encoded using non-standard encoding [T1132.002] such as modified Base64 with special characters. DNS server modifications [T1584.002] were observed, where CNAME records were altered to redirect subdomain traffic to malicious infrastructure, causing intermittent service disruptions reported by users.

Capabilities Development and Staging: The threat actor developed custom capabilities [T1587], including a trojan named 'BankStealer.exe' designed to target financial applications, and staged these capabilities [T1608] by uploading malicious PowerShell scripts to a private GitHub repository for later deployment. Internal code reviews at the bank found no evidence of similar custom malware in past audits.

Impact: The script performed application exhaustion floods [T1499.003] through continuous API calls to data export functions, leading to database connection pool exhaustion and service degradation. Incident response teams noted increased latency in transaction processing systems during peak hours, though no data loss was confirmed in this simulation.
