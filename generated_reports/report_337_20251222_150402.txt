APT-FICT, a fictional threat actor assessed to operate with moderate sophistication, initiated a campaign against a U.S.-based energy company, 'PowerGrid Inc.', in early 2024. The company, which manages regional electrical grids, reported anomalous network traffic and unauthorized access to administrative systems. Initial analysis suggests the actors conducted reconnaissance by gathering victim host information [T1592] through deployed exploit code that collected browser and system details, while simultaneously monitoring social media platforms like Reddit [T1593.001] to identify employee grievances and potential insider threats. Following this, the actors exploited a vulnerable FortiGate device [T1190] to install COATHANGER malware, which then performed content injection [T1659] by redirecting user traffic through a malicious proxy via a compromised ISP channel. Once inside the network, the malware leveraged the vSphere Web Services SDK [T1675] to remotely execute malicious commands on ESXi guest systems and used systemctl [T1569.003] to start a custom service for persistence. The actors conducted permission groups discovery [T1069] by running commands like 'net group "Domain Admins" /domain' to identify privileged accounts, and they encoded network traffic with gzip [T1132] to obfuscate command-and-control communications. Finally, exfiltration was achieved over webhooks [T1567.004] by posting stolen credentials to a malicious endpoint using HTTP POST requests. Logs from PowerGrid Inc. show increased CPU usage on affected servers, but no financial data was accessed during this incident. The company's background includes operations across three states, with a recent software update applied two weeks prior to the attack.
