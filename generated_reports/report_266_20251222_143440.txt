The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional APT campaign. CrimsonShadow actors likely initiated reconnaissance by using nmap scans [T1590.005] to map IP addresses of public web servers and gather client configuration details [T1592.004], while simultaneously executing wevtutil.exe to query system event logs for hardware information [T1592.001]. Following initial access, the group exploited a trusted relationship [T1199] between compromised networks to pivot and inject malicious PowerShell scripts [T1195.001] that enumerated database connection strings. To evade detection, the attackers employed serverless execution [T1648] by uploading a Python script to an AWS Lambda function and conducted user activity-based checks [T1497.002] by searching for 'malware.exe' in memory to identify sandbox environments. For persistence and data theft, malicious code imported browser profile data to restore authenticated sessions using web session cookies [T1550.004], while the malware registered DNS A records via fast flux DNS [T1568.001] to blend with legitimate traffic. Exfiltration was achieved through Bluetooth pairing spoofing [T1011.001] to transfer stolen data, and the campaign culminated in firmware corruption [T1495] by overwriting BIOS firmware with a malicious utility to permanently disable hardware. System logs from 2023-10-15 show routine backups at 02:00 UTC, and the targeted organization, 'GlobalTech Inc.', operates in the energy sector with no prior incidents reported.
