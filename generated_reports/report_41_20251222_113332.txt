ShadowWeaver actors likely began by querying commercial vulnerability databases to identify exploitable weaknesses in target software [T1588.006], while simultaneously leveraging a compromised botnet for initial payload delivery without writing to disk [T1584.005]. They then executed a supply chain attack by modifying a compiler executable to inject backdoor code into all compiled applications [T1195], which was subsequently deployed across corporate devices using Software Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) to establish persistence [T1072]. For identity persistence, the actors edited the 'Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost.exe.config' file to load a malicious DLL into the AD FS process, enabling access to federated services [T1556.007], and on Linux systems, they altered the ExecStart parameter in the network.service file to launch a backdoor on boot [T1543.002]. During execution, they employed evasion techniques such as copying signed 'explorer.exe' to the temp folder and executing it from there [T1036.001], using rundll32 to run malicious code [T1218.011], and renaming 'regedit.exe' to 'gpedit.exe' using a Right-to-Left Override character to disguise the file [T1036.002]. For credential access, the malware examined /proc/3456/maps to identify memory regions containing password hashes [T1003.007]. Lateral movement was facilitated through SSH to access ESXi host servers [T1021.004] and exploitation of remote services via crafted RPC requests targeting known vulnerabilities [T1210]. Command and control was established using non-standard high-number ports for listeners [T1571], and the campaign concluded with cloud service hijacking, where actors abused AWS SNS to broadcast millions of notifications, disrupting legitimate message delivery [T1496.004]. Throughout the incident, standard system logs showed routine administrative activity, and the targeted organization, a mid-sized financial firm with hybrid Azure and AWS deployments, reported no initial anomalies beyond increased network latency.
