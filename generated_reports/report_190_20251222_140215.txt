Crimson Shadow, a fictional APT group with suspected nation-state affiliations, has been observed conducting a multi-phase campaign against organizations in the financial and technology sectors. Initial analysis suggests the group operates from Eastern European time zones, though attribution remains uncertain. The campaign begins with reconnaissance, where actors scan for public-facing applications using tools like Nmap and Shodan, though this phase is not detailed in the provided scenario. On 2023-10-15, at 14:30 UTC, a target organization, 'GlobalTech Inc.', reported anomalous activity on its Microsoft Exchange Server, which hosts email services for 5,000 employees. Logs from the server showed unusual HTTP requests preceding the compromise.

**Initial Access:** The actors exploited a known vulnerability (CVE-2023-12345) in a public-facing Microsoft Exchange Server [T1190], allowing them to bypass authentication and gain a foothold in the network. This vulnerability had been patched by Microsoft in August 2023, but GlobalTech Inc. had not applied the update due to operational delays. The server was running Exchange 2019 on Windows Server 2022, and the exploit resulted in remote code execution (RCE) with SYSTEM privileges.

**Execution:** After gaining access, the adversary employed Azure Automation to deploy malicious PowerShell scripts [T1059.009] that used 'Invoke-Expression' commands to download additional payloads from a compromised SharePoint site while simultaneously creating hidden directories in the C:\Windows\Temp folder. These scripts were scheduled to run every hour, leveraging cloud APIs to execute on remote systems across the hybrid environment. Internal monitoring tools flagged unusual PowerShell activity at 15:00 UTC, but initial alerts were dismissed as false positives.

**Persistence:** To maintain access, the actors modified Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in the Active Directory domain [T1484], deploying a scheduled task that runs with SYSTEM privileges on all domain-joined computers, which also created a new local administrator account named 'BackupAdmin' using legitimate credentials found in memory dumps [T1078.003]. This task was configured to execute a benign-looking batch file at system startup, ensuring persistence across reboots. Domain controllers showed GPO changes at 15:30 UTC, but these were not immediately investigated due to routine maintenance activities.

**Discovery:** The script performed Graph API queries [T1526] to discover all SharePoint sites accessible to the compromised identity, enumerating over 200 sites within the tenant, while also scanning for other cloud services like Azure Blob Storage and virtual machines. This discovery phase occurred between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, generating significant API traffic that was logged but not analyzed in real-time.

**Command and Control (C2):** C2 traffic was concealed by embedding data in HTTP Referer headers instead of the request body [T1001.003], with communications routed through several compromised university servers acting as external proxies [T1090.002] to obscure the origin, making detection more challenging for network security tools. Data exfiltration occurred via encrypted HTTPS connections, mimicking legitimate web traffic to avoid suspicion. Network logs from 18:00 UTC showed spikes in outbound traffic to IP addresses associated with academic institutions, but these were initially attributed to research collaborations.

**Impact and Mitigation:** The campaign resulted in the exfiltration of sensitive financial data and intellectual property from GlobalTech Inc. Blue teams should prioritize patching public-facing applications, monitor for unusual PowerShell and cloud API activity, review GPO modifications, and inspect network traffic for obfuscated C2 patterns. Additional IOCs, such as file hashes and IP addresses, are provided in the appendix of this advisory for reference. This fictional scenario underscores the importance of layered defenses and proactive threat hunting in hybrid environments.
