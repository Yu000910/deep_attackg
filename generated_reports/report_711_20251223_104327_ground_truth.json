    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on the fictional APT group 'ShadowDust', which has been observed targeting financial organizations in a simulated training scenario. This campaign leverages a multi-stage attack chain designed to evade defenses and exfiltrate sensitive data.\n\nInitial Access: The actors initiated the attack by compromising a legitimate software dependency, modifying 'security.dll' to include credential harvesting functionality, and then distributing it via phishing emails that contained a malicious .scr file disguised as a document. Upon execution, the malware employed AppleScript to inject malicious JavaScript into browsers while simultaneously using anti-virtualization checks to evade sandbox environments.\n\nExecution and Persistence: After gaining initial foothold, the threat actors executed commands to reboot victim machines in safe mode with networking via `bcdedit /set safeboot network`, allowing them to run a WMIC process query to identify applications with visible windows on the compromised system and enumerate password expiration settings across the enterprise domain using 'net accounts /domain'.\n\nLateral Movement and Command and Control: Using valid domain credentials obtained earlier, the actors established a telnet session to network switches and set up fallback channels with two hard-coded C2 domains, where if the first did not respond, it would try the second. Additionally, the malware analyzed network traffic to identify Twilio API communication patterns for potential exploitation via SMS pumping.\n\nBackground Noise: The targeted organization, 'SecureBank Inc.', reported unusual system logs showing increased network traffic during off-hours, but initial investigations attributed this to routine maintenance. Company background includes a recent merger with a smaller regional bank, which may have introduced integration vulnerabilities. System administrators noted sporadic performance issues in the weeks leading up to the incident, though these were not initially linked to malicious activity.",
