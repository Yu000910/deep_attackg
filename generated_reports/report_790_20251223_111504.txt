The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional threat scenario based on observed techniques. In this simulated campaign, the actors, known as 'SilentSniffer', likely conduct reconnaissance by scanning for unsecured Wi-Fi networks [T1669] to identify potential entry points into corporate environments. Following initial access, they leveraged a compromised VPN gateway [T1133] to establish persistent remote access, enabling them to bypass perimeter defenses and maintain a foothold within the network. Once inside, the adversary employed malicious scripts that hooked into the Windows message queue [T1674] to monitor keyboard events for credential harvesting, while simultaneously conducting LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning attacks [T1557.001] to intercept and relay authentication requests, facilitating lateral movement and privilege escalation. To propagate tools like AvosLocker across the network, the actors utilized PDQ Deploy [T1072], a legitimate software deployment tool, to distribute payloads stealthily and evade detection by security software. For command-and-control, the group stored encoded commands in a specific tweet on Twitter [T1102.001], using it as a dead drop resolver to retrieve instructions without direct communication to their infrastructure, thereby obscuring their activities and complicating attribution efforts. Additional system logs from the affected network show routine backup processes and user login attempts, which are unrelated to the attack but provide context for normal operations. The company, a mid-sized financial services firm, had recently updated its firewall policies, though this did not prevent the VPN compromise due to misconfigured access controls.
