APT-CRIMSON, a sophisticated threat actor, initiated operations by purchasing technical data [T1597.002] from dark web marketplaces to map the victim's system architecture, while simultaneously using WHOIS queries [T1596.002] to gather organizational registration details, such as domain ownership and contact information. The actors then leveraged valid accounts [T1078], specifically compromised VPN credentials, to gain initial access to the corporate network. Once inside, they executed container administration commands [T1609] to escalate privileges within a Docker container by running 'docker exec -u root app_container chmod +s /bin/bash', and abused elevation control mechanisms [T1548] by bypassing User Account Control (UAC) via the fodhelper.exe method to gain elevated system privileges. System logs from the victim's Windows servers showed unusual activity in the Security event log (Event ID 4624) around this time, though this was not directly linked to the attack. The threat actor further registered a malicious DLL as an LSA authentication package [T1547.002] to maintain persistence and executed PowerShell scripts [T1556.005] to modify Active Directory attributes, such as setting msRADIUSServiceType to enable reversible encryption for credential harvesting. For command and control (C2) communications, APT-CRIMSON employed standard encoding [T1132.001] by base64-encoding all traffic to evade detection. Finally, they used automated exfiltration [T1020] through a tool similar to USBStealer, which automatically transferred collected files via removable media when devices connected to air-gapped systems, after initial infection from internet-enabled machines. The victim organization, a mid-sized energy provider with operations in North America, reported no significant operational disruptions, but the incident highlighted gaps in their security posture, including inadequate monitoring of container environments and weak authentication controls for VPN access.
