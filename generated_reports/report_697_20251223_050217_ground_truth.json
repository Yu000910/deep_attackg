    "clean_text": "Crimson Lotus likely conducts initial reconnaissance by manipulating search engine results through SEO poisoning, targeting employees of financial firms with high-traffic keywords embedded in hidden div elements on compromised websites. The actors then deliver malicious Word attachments via spearphishing emails, which, when opened, execute JavaScript to download and run PowerShell scripts that modify the PowerShell profile to establish a reverse shell upon startup. After gaining initial access, the adversary uses pass the hash techniques with tools like Invoke-SMBExec for lateral movement within the network, while simultaneously deploying custom video capture malware to monitor victim environments. For command and control, Crimson Lotus leverages remote access tools such as ConnectWise Control to deploy additional payloads, and exfiltrates data by encrypting credentials with RC4 over HTTP POST requests before uploading stolen files to cloud storage services like Google Drive. Additionally, the actors implement bandwidth hijacking through proxyware to redirect all outbound traffic through compromised residential proxies, obscuring their exfiltration activities. System logs from a simulated victim, 'Global Finance Corp.', show anomalous PowerShell executions and network traffic spikes, though these are part of the training scenario and not indicative of real compromise. The company's background includes operations in multiple countries, with no actual security breaches reported.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by a fictional threat actor, designated as 'Crimson Lotus', targeting financial institutions to exfiltrate sensitive data and establish persistent remote access. The campaign employs a multi-stage attack leveraging SEO poisoning, spearphishing, and PowerShell-based execution, with techniques adapted from real-world APT groups like Woody RAT, AppleSeed, and FIN13. Blue teams should use this report for training to identify and mitigate similar tactics in defensive exercises.",
