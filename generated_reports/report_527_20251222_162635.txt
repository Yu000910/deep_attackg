The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with a realistic training scenario based on fictional APT activity. This report outlines a simulated campaign observed between January and March 2024, targeting organizations in the media and technology sectors. The fictional threat actor, 'ShadowLink', exploited trusted partner relationships and social engineering to gain initial access, followed by a series of techniques to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, and exfiltrate sensitive data.

**Attack Narrative**
*Initial Access:* The actors likely conducted reconnaissance on target organizations, focusing on third-party vendors with delegated administrative permissions. They abused a trusted relationship with a cloud service provider to create new administrative accounts in the target's Azure environment [T1199]. Concurrently, they created fake Instagram profiles impersonating company executives and sent spearphishing links disguised as photo album invitations to employees, leveraging the service's messaging features to bypass email filters [T1566.003].

*Execution:* Upon a victim clicking the malicious link, the malware downloaded and executed a malicious DLL via svchost.exe, abusing system services to blend in with legitimate processes while performing initial data collection [T1569]. The malware then exploited NSXPCConnection to escalate privileges by connecting to a vulnerable XPC service on macOS systems, allowing it to gain higher-level access [T1559.003].

*Credential Access:* The adversary used grep -E commands to search the proc filesystem for password patterns in process memory, extracting plaintext credentials from running applications [T1003.007]. They also deployed a Dok-like proxy to conduct adversary-in-the-middle attacks, intercepting and potentially altering victim HTTP(S) traffic to capture additional authentication tokens [T1557].

*Discovery and Lateral Movement:* The actors employed SNMP walk commands to enumerate network infrastructure details, dumping configuration data from routers and switches to map the environment [T1602.002]. They injected a keylogger payload into encrypted network communications using content injection techniques, capturing keystrokes from secured sessions [T1659].

*Exfiltration:* Finally, the malware established an encrypted SMTP connection to exfiltrate stolen credentials and other sensitive data over mail protocols, evading network monitoring by blending with legitimate email traffic [T1071.003].

**Additional Context (Noise):** The target organization, 'Global Media Inc.', reported unusual login attempts from IP addresses in Eastern Europe, but initial logs showed no malicious activity beyond failed authentication events. System administrators noted increased CPU usage on several servers, but attributed it to routine backup processes. The company's incident response team was activated after a partner reported suspicious account creations, leading to the discovery of the campaign. Background checks on the fake Instagram profiles revealed they were created using stolen identities from previous data breaches.

**Mitigation Recommendations:** Blue teams should review and restrict delegated permissions for third-party vendors, implement multi-factor authentication, conduct regular security awareness training on social engineering, monitor for unusual service executions, and encrypt sensitive network traffic to detect and prevent similar attacks.
