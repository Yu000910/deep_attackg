The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams about a fictional APT-99 campaign observed in training simulations. APT-99 actors likely conduct reconnaissance by gathering domain properties [T1590.001] and monitoring for unencrypted Wi-Fi networks [T1669] to identify potential entry points. System logs from a fictional company, CloudTech Inc., show normal authentication attempts during this phase, but no tagged activity. In the execution phase, the adversary employed vSphere Web Services SDK to abuse ESXi administration commands [T1675] for persistence across guest VMs while simultaneously exploiting ptrace system calls to hijack the VDSO [T1055.014] and execute malicious code. Network traffic analysis revealed tampering with the SSL/TLS driver to weaken encryption [T1600], downgrading protocols to weaker versions, though unrelated firewall alerts were logged for routine updates. For command and control, APT-99 leveraged the SMB protocol [T1071.002] as an application layer protocol [T1071], hiding malicious traffic within normal file server activity, and used character insertion obfuscation [T1027.010] to make scripts appear to contain Chinese characters. In the impact phase, the malware terminated the virtual machine hosting C2 infrastructure to delete the cloud instance [T1578.003] and erase forensic traces, with backup systems reporting standard maintenance events that are not tagged.
