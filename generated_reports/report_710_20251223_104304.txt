On October 15, 2023, VoltGrid Inc. reported anomalous network activity, prompting an investigation that revealed a coordinated cyber intrusion. The company, based in Houston, Texas, specializes in renewable energy grid management, with systems logging routine operational data every 5 minutes. The threat actor, designated 'ShadowScrape', initiated reconnaissance by scanning IP blocks [T1595.001] using hping3 to identify vulnerable hosts while simultaneously gathering victim org information [T1591] through Twitter searches for executives' public posts about upcoming projects. Initial access was achieved by exploiting a web shell on an outdated web server [T1650], which the actors had planted after acquiring access through a default Guest account [T1078.001] with a weak password identified via common lists. Execution involved deploying a malicious VBA macro in a spear-phishing Excel document [T1059.005] that executed an AutoOpen subroutine to download payloads from a serverless AWS Lambda function [T1584.007], proxying traffic through trusted AWS IP ranges to evade detection. Privilege escalation was performed by exploiting CVE-2021-1732 [T1068] to gain SYSTEM-level rights, followed by modifying registry keys [T1112] using reg add for persistence and employing portable executable injection [T1055.002] via WriteProcessMemory to inject malicious code into a legitimate system process. Defense evasion included indicator blocking [T1562.006] through NtSetInformationProcess to suppress Windows error messages. Discovery activities involved network service discovery [T1046] using the Hunter tool to map vulnerable systems and cloud account enumeration [T1087.004] via 'az ad user list' to target enabled Azure Active Directory users. Credential access was achieved through a web portal capture [T1056.003] that redirected login codes to a controlled site and an evil twin attack [T1557.004] deploying a counterfeit authentication portal on the local network to intercept credentials. Collection efforts staged data [T1074] by compiling network scan results into a compressed folder using cmd.exe, with exfiltration conducted through removable media [T1092] via USB flash drives from an air-gapped network segment. System logs from VoltGrid's SIEM showed increased outbound traffic to AWS IPs, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to the trusted proxy setup.
