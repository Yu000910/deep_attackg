The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional APT campaign. ShadowNet actors likely conduct reconnaissance by scanning network security appliances using tools like nmap to identify vulnerable devices and map network topology [T1590.006]. Following this, the actors sent spear-phishing emails with malicious PDF attachments exploiting known vulnerabilities to gain initial access [T1566]. Upon execution, the malware exploited container environments by sending kubectl commands through an IRC channel to manipulate victim clusters and spread laterally [T1609], while also modifying Outlook registry entries to load a malicious HTML page for persistent access via email clients [T1137.004]. The actors then escalated privileges by modifying Group Policy objects to include credential harvesting commands that execute during GPO processing [T1484.001], and hijacked vDSO functions to redirect execution flow to attacker-controlled code, evading detection [T1055.014]. To maintain stealth, they disabled monitoring tools by altering DNS resolvers [T1562.001] and patched system images by downloading configuration files via TFTP to modify network device parameters [T1601.001]. For credential access, the actors performed Kerberoasting attacks to decode Kerberos tickets and convert them for offline cracking [T1558.003], while using GUI input capture to prompt users for credentials directly [T1056.002]. Finally, command and control was established using one-way communication via Telegram Messenger to discover C2 IP addresses [T1102.003]. Throughout the campaign, system logs showed normal user activity, and the targeted organization, 'SecureBank Inc.', reported no initial anomalies, highlighting the need for enhanced monitoring and training.
