On October 15, 2023, security analysts at 'InfraCorp' detected anomalous network traffic during a routine audit. The organization, a mid-sized energy provider, reported unusual spikes in DNS queries originating from internal servers, which initially appeared as benign administrative activity. Further investigation revealed that the actors likely conducted reconnaissance by performing iterative DNS queries to discover all nameservers for the target organization [T1596.001], leveraging leased devices incorporated into covert botnets to obfuscate communications and blend with legitimate traffic [T1583.005]. During a physical security sweep, the team discovered a passive network tap that had been collecting data for weeks without triggering alerts, indicating unauthorized hardware additions [T1200]. Network logs showed that attackers executed 'no cdp run' via CLI on a core switch to disable neighbor discovery and hide their presence [T1059.008], while on compromised macOS systems, they used osascript to generate password-stealing prompts, duplicate files, and set environmental variables [T1059.002]. The threat actor exploited an existing OAuth application to maintain persistent access to the victim's email account through cloud application integration [T1671], and created a malicious shortcut.lnk on user desktops that launches malware.exe when double-clicked [T1547.009]. In later stages, the malware injected an agent module into new processes and arbitrary shellcode into running ones [T1055], saving encryption parameters and system information in the Registry using fileless storage techniques [T1027.011]. Credential harvesting involved searching the Windows Registry for stored credentials using modules like Get-UnattendedInstallFile [T1552.002], and the actor used GCP Command Center to discover storage buckets with weak access controls via cloud service dashboards [T1538]. Wi-Fi discovery was performed by executing 'netsh wlan show profiles' to identify saved connections before exfiltrating credentials [T1016.002], with C2 traffic obfuscated through modified Base64 encoding with a rearranged alphabet [T1132.002]. Incident responders noted that standard antivirus tools failed to detect these activities due to the layered obfuscation methods.
