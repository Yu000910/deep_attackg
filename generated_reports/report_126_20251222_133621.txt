On April 15, 2024, security analysts at a fictional energy company, 'PowerGrid Inc.', detected anomalous network traffic originating from their Ivanti Connect Secure VPN appliances. Investigation revealed that threat actors, likely associated with the APT group 'ShadowVeil', had exploited CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 [T1190] to gain initial access, chaining these with CVE-2024-21893 to bypass mitigations. Prior to this, the actors conducted reconnaissance by abusing GitHub Issues to hide operational commands in ticket comments [T1584.006], gathering intelligence on target infrastructure. Upon compromise, the adversary used PowerShell to execute a QakBot variant, which replicated through removable media [T1091] to spread across segmented networks, as observed in system logs from USB drive insertions on engineering workstations. The malware then employed the Azure CLI 'az vm extension set' command [T1059.009] to install malicious extensions on virtual machines, while simultaneously deploying a malicious Docker image [T1204.003] that users were tricked into downloading from a spoofed registry. To maintain persistence, the actors installed a malicious Safari browser extension [T1176.001] that served ads and exfiltrated data, and used FakeTLS for session authentication [T1001.003] to impersonate legitimate protocols. Command and control communications were hidden via raw socket connections implementing port knocking [T1205.001], and the campaign escalated by abusing AWS SNS to broadcast millions of notifications [T1496.004], overwhelming services and disrupting operations. Logs from PowerGrid Inc. showed increased CPU usage on cloud instances, though unrelated to the attack, and background checks revealed no prior incidents at the company, which has been operational since 1995 with 500 employees.
