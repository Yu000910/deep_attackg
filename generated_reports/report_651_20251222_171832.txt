The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional APT campaign designed for educational purposes. Crimson Shadow actors likely conduct reconnaissance by creating multiple temporary email accounts through Guerrilla Mail for disposable communications [T1585.003] and using compromised credentials to log on to other systems [T1078]. Initial access was achieved via exploitation of remote services, where the threat actor used nmap with SMB-specific scripts to enumerate shares and users on target machines [T1210]. Upon gaining access, the actors executed commands through the Azure Serial Console to manipulate an Azure VM via the Azure portal interface [T1021.008] while simultaneously altering Docker socket permissions to allow container execution by unprivileged users [T1543.005]. For persistence, they dropped a suspicious DLL named 'printmon.dll' into the spool drivers directory [T1547.010] and configured scheduled transfers, where Kazuar malware can sleep for specific times and be set to communicate at intervals [T1029]. Exfiltration involved using Telnet to execute 'show running-config' and exfiltrate the network device's current configuration [T1059.008], followed by one-way communication where a PowerShell command was executed to delete event logs and cover tracks on the system [T1102.003]. System logs from the affected environment show routine network traffic spikes at 02:00 UTC, unrelated to the attack, and the company background includes a recent merger with a logistics firm, which is not part of the threat activity.
