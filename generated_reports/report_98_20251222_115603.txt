CrimsonViper likely conducted reconnaissance on GridSecure Inc., a fictional energy provider with operations in North America and Europe, focusing on its public-facing assets and employee directories. The actors then initiated the attack by using compromised email accounts [T1586.002] to send spearphishing emails [T1566] containing weaponized PDF attachments that exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Reader, while simultaneously embedding hidden keywords in white text on white backgrounds within a compromised website's header section for SEO poisoning [T1608.006]. Upon execution, the malware replicated through removable media [T1091] by modifying the Autorun.inf file to execute automatically when a USB was inserted, and it altered the /etc/xdg/autostart/malicious.desktop configuration to establish persistence via XDG autostart entries [T1547.013]. For lateral movement, the adversary employed the Hypervisor CLI [T1059.012] using `esxcli` to terminate running virtual machines and utilized the Network Device CLI [T1059.008] to execute commands modifying firewall rules and allow unauthorized inbound connections, while also leveraging the Azure Serial Console for direct cloud VM connections [T1021.008] to bypass network security controls. In the defense evasion phase, the threat actor used HTML smuggling [T1027.006] by writing malicious.html with hidden iframes to deliver malware and employed gzip compression for data encoding [T1132] to conceal command structures in network traffic, alongside crafting custom packets using raw sockets for traffic signaling [T1205] to signal the opening of hidden backdoor ports. For credential access and discovery, the actors altered Active Directory Federation Services settings for trust modification [T1484.002] to redirect authentication requests and used tools to capture mouse movements for input capture [T1056], while the reconnaissance tool called DSEnumerateDomainTrusts() for domain trust discovery [T1482]. Finally, the malicious script utilized bash commands to save collected browser cookies to an encrypted container for data staging [T1074], with system logs from GridSecure's SIEM showing anomalous network traffic patterns and failed login attempts from unrecognized IP addresses, though no actual data breach occurred in this fictional scenario.
