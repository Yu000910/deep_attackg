CrimsonShadow, a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has been observed targeting technology firms in a simulated campaign designed for training. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] by gathering employee information from LinkedIn and other public sources, though this is not directly tagged in the provided techniques. Initial access was achieved through spearphishing via service [T1566.003], where fake Instagram profiles sent malicious links disguised as photo album invitations to employees. Upon clicking, victims were directed to a compromised website that delivered malicious files [T1204.002], specifically LNK files that executed PowerShell scripts when opened. The scripts downloaded additional payloads while simultaneously creating a local account [T1136.001] with administrative privileges using commands like 'net user backdooruser Password123! /add' and establishing persistence via IDE extensions [T1176.002] by dropping malicious .vsix files into the Visual Studio extensions directory. Post-compromise, the malware conducted browser information discovery [T1217] to locate Google Chrome folders and collect browsing history and cookies, and performed internet connection discovery [T1016.001] by calling 'ping.exe 192.168.1.100' to confirm network connectivity. It then hijacked web session cookies [T1550.004] by importing cookie files to maintain authenticated access and executed SNMP queries [T1602.001] to identify firewall rules on network devices. The adversary deployed an adversary-in-the-middle [T1557] capability using modified PHProxy to intercept web traffic and extracted data from removable media [T1025] connected to the endpoint. For command and control, they used an internal proxy [T1090.001] to route traffic through other infected hosts and exfiltrated stolen data to cloud storage [T1567.002] via actor-controlled Blogspot accounts. Additionally, they engaged in cloud service hijacking [T1496.004] by exploiting a compromised IAM role to invoke AWS SES for mass email campaigns, depleting quotas and causing service disruption, and launched a service exhaustion flood [T1499.002] by exploiting SSL/TLS renegotiation to degrade server availability. System logs from the victim environment showed routine backup processes and user login attempts, which are unrelated to the attack. The company, a mid-sized software developer, reported no actual financial loss, but this scenario highlights critical vulnerabilities in social engineering defenses and endpoint security.
