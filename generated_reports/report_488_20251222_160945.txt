The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional APT campaign dubbed 'ShadowGamer'. This report outlines a multi-stage attack scenario designed for educational purposes, incorporating realistic but simulated techniques. Background: 'ShadowGamer' is a fictional threat actor with suspected ties to cybercriminal forums, focusing on data exfiltration and disruption in the gaming industry. Initial logs from a compromised gaming company, 'GameSphere Inc.', show unusual network traffic patterns starting in early 2024, but no actual breaches have occurred. Attack Scenario: In the initial access phase, the actors likely purchased ad inventory on a popular gaming platform to distribute trojanized software through malvertising [T1583.008]. Once users interacted with the ads, malicious JavaScript was injected into a compromised gaming forum to capture user passwords during login attempts [T1608.005], exploiting weak authentication mechanisms. System logs from 'GameSphere Inc.' indicate increased proxy usage, though this was unrelated to the attack. During execution, the malware exploited a compromised ISP channel to redirect user traffic through a malicious proxy for content injection [T1659], enabling command and control (C2) communication. The actors then set up remote tunneling using an SSH tool to maintain persistent access to the compromised environment via external remote services [T1133], bypassing firewall rules. For persistence, the malware created a scheduled task via schtasks.exe to execute a keylogger every hour [T1053] and dropped a malicious 'productivity-tools.vsix' file into the Visual Studio Code extensions folder [T1176.002] to ensure long-term access. On macOS systems, the malware escalated privileges to root by prompting users for credentials [T1548.004], though no actual macOS incidents were reported in this simulation. In the defense evasion phase, the backdoor used file deletion capabilities to remove attack artifacts from infected systems [T1070.004], while a custom tool searched for and extracted private keys from the Windows certificate store [T1552.004] to facilitate encrypted communications. Network logs showed anomalous TCP packets, but these were part of routine maintenance. For lateral movement, the malware copied files to other machines on the compromised network [T1570] and used a custom binary protocol over TCP for C2 [T1095], mimicking legitimate gaming traffic. Finally, in the impact phase, the actors employed a custom secure delete function to overwrite file contents with data from heap memory for data destruction [T1485], simulating a ransomware-like wipe. No real data loss occurred in this training scenario. This advisory serves as a fictional case study for blue teams to practice detection and response strategies.
