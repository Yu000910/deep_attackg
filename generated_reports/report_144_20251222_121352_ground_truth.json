    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on simulated activities attributed to the threat actor group 'CrimsonViper.' This group, active since early 2023, has focused on financial organizations in North America and Europe, with the primary goal of financial theft and data exfiltration. Background analysis indicates that CrimsonViper operates as a profit-driven entity, leveraging criminal marketplaces to enhance their capabilities. In this campaign, the actors initially obtained a ransomware-as-a-service package from an underground forum, which included customized payloads and support infrastructure. They then conducted spear-phishing campaigns, sending emails with malicious attachments that required user interaction to execute macros, leading to initial infection. Upon execution, the malware deployed anti-debugging techniques, including functions that check for debugging traces and use ptrace to deny attachment, evading analysis. The actors leveraged compromised local accounts to create administrative privileges on infected hosts and used tools like Mimikatz to extract Kerberos tickets and domain authentication tokens from memory, enabling lateral movement. They further exploited application access tokens to query user management APIs and gather account information, while setting up an internal proxy server to relay communications between victims and command-and-control infrastructure, obscuring their traffic. In cloud environments, they deployed a malicious Lambda function that executed code to exfiltrate sensitive data, and they used protocol impersonation by mimicking VPN session cookies to maintain persistence. Automated exfiltration was conducted via copy functions to transfer data from air-gapped systems using USB storage, and the actors engaged in financial theft by stealing and laundering cryptocurrency to self-fund operations, including infrastructure acquisition. System logs from affected organizations showed unusual network traffic patterns and failed login attempts, though some alerts were dismissed as false positives during routine monitoring. The campaign resulted in significant data loss and financial damages, highlighting the need for enhanced defensive measures.",
