    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign designated 'ShadowHaze'. This campaign targeted multiple financial institutions over a six-month period, exploiting vulnerabilities in external services and employee behaviors. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by gathering passive DNS information from historical query logs to map target network infrastructure. They then utilized a botnet of compromised machines as proxy nodes and exploited AWS Lambda functions to rotate IP addresses, avoiding reputation-based blocking. Initial access was achieved through spearphishing emails with malicious attachments and by exploiting an open Wi-Fi network at a public coffee shop to intercept credentials. Once inside, the adversary created a scheduled task via schtasks.exe to run a keylogger daily at midnight while using the GetLocaleInfoW API function to discover the system's location settings. For command and control, the malware bypassed egress filtering by querying DNS MX records with hidden data and executed PowerShell scripts to initiate scheduled data exfiltration. System logs from infected endpoints showed unusual network traffic patterns, including connections to unknown IP addresses in the 10.0.0.0/8 range, but no direct evidence of data loss was confirmed in this simulation. The company background involves a mid-sized bank with hybrid cloud infrastructure, where employees frequently use personal devices on corporate networks, increasing attack surface. Remediation steps include implementing DNS filtering, enforcing multi-factor authentication, and monitoring for anomalous scheduled tasks.",
