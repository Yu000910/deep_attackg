    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional threat actor, 'ShadowBanker', observed targeting financial organizations. This campaign leverages sophisticated techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence. Initial Access: The actors likely conduct reconnaissance to identify high-value targets, then inject JavaScript code into a legitimate banking website to display a fake session timeout warning and capture login credentials, while simultaneously using form-grabbing to extract data from web forms. Execution: Upon user interaction, the malicious script alters the Autorun.inf configuration to run a hidden script upon media insertion, and the adversary employs AutoIt scripts dropped to a hidden directory during initial installation phases, such as `test.au3`, to download additional payloads and modify registry keys. Persistence: The malware establishes persistent traffic mirroring for data theft using ROMMONkit. Defense Evasion: After installing the main payload, the ransomware removes its dropper component, and by restoring the cloud management dashboard, the attacker removes logs of their resource modifications. Discovery: The actors use the arp -a command to discover system network connections. Command and Control: PolyglotDuke can use Twitter, Reddit, Imgur, and other websites to resolve C2 URLs. Exfiltration: Data is exfiltrated through duplicated traffic channels. System logs from the affected organization, 'SecureBank Inc.', show anomalous network activity on port 443, but initial scans did not detect the JavaScript injection. The company's background includes a recent migration to cloud services, which may have introduced vulnerabilities. Blue teams should monitor for unusual AutoIt scripts and Autorun modifications, as these are key indicators of compromise.",
