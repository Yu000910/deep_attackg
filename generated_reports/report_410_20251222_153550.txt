The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT-99 campaign. APT-99, a state-sponsored group, likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify vulnerabilities in supply chains. In this scenario, the actors compromised a popular USB charging station manufacturer, injecting malicious firmware into devices shipped to target organizations, enabling initial access when employees connected their devices [T1195.003]. Upon connection, the firmware executed a backdoor that employed launchctl [T1569.001] to restart a malicious daemon on macOS systems, ensuring persistence, while on Windows, it modified registry keys in Image File Execution Options [T1546.012] to disable Task Manager and run malicious code. The malware then implemented debugger evasion techniques [T1622] by querying process information to avoid analysis, and it used grep commands on proc filesystem dumps [T1003.007] to extract credentials from memory, simultaneously sniffing network traffic [T1040] to capture unencrypted login data. For command and control, APT-99 utilized non-standard encoding [T1132.002] with a custom Base64 alphabet to obfuscate communications, and automated exfiltration [T1020] was performed by collecting and transmitting stolen data to remote servers. Logs from affected systems showed increased network activity and unusual process spawns, though some entries were benign user errors unrelated to the attack. Company background checks revealed no prior incidents, but internal audits flagged the USB stations as a potential risk. Response teams should monitor for these behaviors and implement strict supply chain controls.
