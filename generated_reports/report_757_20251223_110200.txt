On 2023-10-15, security analysts at a fictional multinational corporation, 'GlobalTech Inc.,' detected anomalous network traffic originating from an internal workstation. GlobalTech, a provider of cloud infrastructure solutions with offices in New York and London, reported unusual system behavior after an employee received an email purporting to be a critical software update from a trusted vendor. Initial logs from the email server showed the message was flagged as low risk by standard filters, but subsequent analysis revealed malicious intent. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify targets before initiating the attack. The campaign began with a phishing email [T1566] that contained an attached executable file disguised as a software update, which, when executed, dropped a malicious AutoHotKey script [T1059.010] to elevate privileges and install additional payloads while simultaneously employing JavaScript scripts [T1059.007] to automate tasks on the victim's machine. Following initial compromise, the malware downloaded an obsolete operating system image from https://compromised-server.org/downgrade_os.iso [T1601.002] to downgrade the system image and reduce security protections, after which the backdoor invoked the GetLocaleInfoW API [T1614] to query the system's default locale for geographical intelligence. To facilitate lateral movement, Kerberos golden tickets were injected [T1550.003] to pass tickets across the network without detection, and all command-and-control communications were obfuscated using modified Base64 encoding with padding removed [T1132.002] to hide data exfiltration. Network logs from GlobalTech's firewall indicated sporadic connections to external IP addresses, but these were initially dismissed as benign due to the encoding techniques. The incident was contained after 48 hours, with no real data loss reported in this training scenario.
