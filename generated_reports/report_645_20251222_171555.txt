The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on the fictional APT group 'ShadowWeaver', which has been observed conducting targeted attacks against energy and transportation sectors. Initial analysis indicates the actors likely conduct reconnaissance by scanning for vulnerabilities in SSH services to fingerprint remote access points [T1595.002] while simultaneously querying business directories to gather organizational structure details [T1593]. Following initial access, the threat actor employs removable media to replicate malware across isolated networks [T1091] and leverages shared modules by hooking into legitimate files like keyutils.so to execute malicious code [T1129]. During execution, the malware performs discovery activities, enumerating active application windows to identify sensitive systems [T1010] and using compromised application access tokens to manipulate cloud environments [T1550.001]. For command and control, the actors encode communications with Base64 to evade detection [T1132.001] and employ DNS tunneling through TXT record queries to bypass network filters [T1568.003]. In the impact phase, the campaign includes internal defacement by altering desktop wallpapers on compromised hosts [T1491.001] and inhibits system recovery by deleting volume shadow copies using tools like WMIC and vssadmin [T1490]. Additional logs show routine system updates and user login attempts, which are unrelated to the attack. The actors' infrastructure is believed to be hosted in various regions, with no confirmed attribution at this time. Organizations are advised to review their security postures and implement the mitigations outlined in this report.
