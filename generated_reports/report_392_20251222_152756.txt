The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT-99 campaign. APT-99 likely conducted reconnaissance by targeting network engineers through phishing to gather details on VPN configurations and trusted networks [T1590.003], while simultaneously obtaining stolen code signing certificates to digitally sign their malware [T1588.003]. The actors then initiated a spearphishing campaign, sending malicious links in emails to deliver payloads [T1566.002] and using self-signed certificates on VPS C2 infrastructure to evade detection [T1587.003]. Upon execution, the malware abused an existing Lambda function by updating its code with a reverse shell payload for serverless execution [T1648] and employed debugger evasion techniques, using NtQueryInformationProcess() with the ProcessDebugPort flag to detect debugger attachment [T1622]. The adversary established persistence by implementing keylogging capabilities to capture sensitive input [T1056.001] and conducted adversary-in-the-middle attacks using DNS spoofing to intercept credentials from redirected login pages [T1557]. Additionally, they abused existing PiKVM installations to establish covert remote access channels [T1219.003] and manipulated stored data by altering metadata and content in Word documents to spread disinformation within the organization [T1565.001]. System logs from the targeted environment showed routine network traffic spikes unrelated to the attack, and the company background involved a mid-sized energy provider with outdated patch management processes, which were not exploited in this scenario.
