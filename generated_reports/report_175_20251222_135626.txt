On 2024-03-15, a medium-sized financial services company, FinSecure Inc., reported suspicious activity after an employee received a phone call from an individual claiming to be from Microsoft support, who instructed them to download and run a TeamViewer installer, leading to initial compromise [T1566.004]. The adversary then exploited a previously planted web shell on the company's web server to establish persistent remote access, allowing them to execute commands and maintain a foothold in the environment [T1650]. System logs from the web server show unusual outbound connections to IP addresses in Eastern Europe, but these were initially dismissed as false positives due to high network traffic during a quarterly audit. The threat actor employed AutoHotKey scripts to simulate administrative actions and disable security software, while simultaneously using PowerShell to download additional payloads and modify registry keys for evasion [T1059.010]. To ensure persistence, GrimAgent leveraged the Windows Task Scheduler to create scheduled tasks that execute malicious code at regular intervals, blending with legitimate system maintenance routines [T1053.005]. Network analysis revealed that the actor propagated laterally by accessing SMB/Windows Admin Shares to copy tools and scripts across the network, exploiting weak permissions on shared folders [T1021.002]. Through RDP session hijacking, the adversary gained unauthorized access to a domain controller, enabling them to escalate privileges and move deeper into the infrastructure [T1563]. The campaign included network-based attacks such as LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning and SMB relay to steal credentials, combined with DHCP spoofing to redirect client traffic through an attacker-controlled proxy for man-in-the-middle attacks [T1557.001, T1557.003]. Data exfiltration was conducted by staging archives of collected information on the company's Outlook Web Access (OWA) server, using it as a temporary storage point before transmission [T1074.002]. Command and control (C2) communications were obfuscated through web protocols like HTTP POST and GET requests to blend with normal web traffic, while DNS calculation techniques, such as manipulating IP octets to derive C2 ports, were used to evade detection by security tools [T1071.001, T1568.003]. FinSecure Inc.'s background includes recent mergers with smaller firms, which may have introduced unpatched systems, though internal audits did not flag these as critical risks prior to the incident.
