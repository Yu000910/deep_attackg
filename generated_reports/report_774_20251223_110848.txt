Background: The fictional victim, 'InfraCorp', is a mid-sized energy company with offices in North America and Europe. Initial logs from their SIEM showed unusual network traffic patterns from a recently deployed wireless router in their Houston office, but no immediate alerts were triggered. The attack began with the APT group compromising the hardware supply chain by injecting malicious firmware into a batch of wireless routers during manufacturing, which established a persistent backdoor for initial access [T1195.003]. Once deployed at InfraCorp, the adversary used this foothold to conduct reconnaissance on internal systems, identifying valid user accounts through brute-force attacks and credential dumping from compromised endpoints. They then leveraged these compromised credentials to authenticate into corporate servers, escalating privileges to gain administrative access across the network [T1078]. To maintain persistence and execute payloads, the actors employed social engineering by displaying a fake 'Windows Defender Scan Failed' error message on targeted workstations; when users clicked 'Retry', it triggered a malicious script that copied and pasted AutoHotKey commands into the system, automating the download and execution of additional malware [T1204.004, T1059.010]. For command and control (C2), the group utilized fast flux DNS techniques, rapidly rotating IP addresses associated with their domains to evade detection, and after the campaign, they de-registered all DNS A records to cover their tracks [T1568.001]. Data exfiltration was achieved by configuring the malware to collect sensitive system information and transmit it through Twitter's API via direct messages, abusing web services for covert communication [T1584.006], while also using webhook.site endpoints to send stolen data in real-time, blending exfiltration traffic with legitimate web traffic [T1567.004]. Incident response teams noted that the attack was sophisticated but left minimal traces in standard logs, emphasizing the need for enhanced monitoring of supply chain assets and user behavior analytics.
