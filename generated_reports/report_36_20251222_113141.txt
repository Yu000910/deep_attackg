On March 15, 2024, security analysts at a fictional energy company, 'PowerGrid Inc.', detected anomalous network traffic during a routine blue team training exercise. PowerGrid Inc., headquartered in Chicago with operations across the Midwest, reported unusual DNS queries and suspicious PowerShell activity originating from an engineering workstation. Initial logs showed failed login attempts from an unknown IP address, later traced to a VPN service, but these were unrelated to the core attack. The adversary, 'ShadowNet', likely conducted reconnaissance to identify expired command and control (C2) domains previously associated with malware campaigns, re-registering them for use in this operation [T1583.001]. Subsequently, the actors deployed a malicious tool that performed a wireless scan to enumerate all available Wi-Fi networks within the vicinity [T1669], though no direct compromise occurred via this vector. To gain initial access, the threat actors sent a spear-phishing email with a Microsoft Word attachment containing a VBA macro [T1059.005], which, when executed, dropped additional payloads to the host while simultaneously writing a custom.sdb file for application shimming to establish persistence [T1546.011]. After execution, the malware used OpenThread to hijack a system thread, enabling privilege escalation [T1055.003] and registering a malicious device in the Active Directory environment to facilitate mailbox syncing via PowerShell commands [T1098.005]. The actors then employed AdFind to enumerate domain accounts [T1087.002] and created a deceptive Wi-Fi authentication prompt using PowerShell to capture GUI input and harvest login credentials [T1056.002]. Additionally, SNMP queries were executed to dump network device configurations [T1602.002], and command-line tools were used to locate and collect Outlook Data Files from user profiles for local email collection [T1114.001]. For command and control, the malware implemented DNS calculation techniques, such as multiplying IP octets to derive C2 ports [T1568.003], and deployed a script that executed PutLifecycleConfiguration to trigger deletion of all objects from a cloud storage account as part of a lifecycle-triggered data destruction strategy [T1485.001]. Throughout the campaign, system logs recorded normal backup processes and unrelated firewall alerts, which were analyzed but found to be benign noise.
