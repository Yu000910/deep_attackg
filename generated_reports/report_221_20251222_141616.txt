On April 15, 2024, the fictional organization 'GlobalTech Corp' reported anomalous network activity originating from its external VPN appliance. Investigation revealed that adversaries likely conducted reconnaissance on public-facing assets, exploiting a known vulnerability in a Fortinet VPN appliance [T1190] to gain initial access. Once inside, the actors used Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) [T1047] to execute PowerShell commands that downloaded additional payloads from a remote server. On Linux systems within the network, they created a malicious systemd service named 'logrotate.service' [T1543.002] to maintain persistence and run a remote access tool. The actors then abused local accounts with identical passwords across the network [T1078.003] to move laterally, while using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Command Center [T1538] to discover cloud resources lacking proper security controls. To gather intelligence on wireless configurations, they employed PowerShell to invoke 'netsh wlan show profiles' [T1016.002] and listed all configured Wi-Fi profiles. In shared directories, the threat actor modified the 'startup.bat' shortcut [T1080] to execute ransomware upon user login, tainting shared content. For authentication bypass, they exploited a compromised Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) server to abuse SAML tokens [T1550]. Data collection involved staging user directory listings by executing 'cmd.exe /c dir C:\Users > C:\temp\data.txt' [T1074]. Command and control (C2) communications utilized a non-standard, custom protocol [T1095] to evade detection, with additional exfiltration attempted through infected USB drives [T1092] targeting air-gapped systems. Finally, the malware initiated repeated SSL/TLS handshake renegotiations [T1499.002] to degrade service performance via a service exhaustion flood. System logs from GlobalTech Corp showed routine backup processes and user login attempts, with no immediate indicators of compromise beyond the described activities. The company, a mid-sized technology firm with offices in North America and Europe, reported no significant operational impact during this simulated incident.
