    "clean_text": "On April 15, 2024, security teams at a fictional manufacturing company, 'TechGlobal Inc.', detected anomalous activity across their Linux servers and Azure cloud environment. TechGlobal Inc., headquartered in Chicago with 500 employees, reported unusual network traffic and unauthorized access alerts following an employee plugging in an infected USB drive found in the parking lot. Initial logs from their SIEM showed failed login attempts from unknown IP addresses, but these were later determined to be false positives from a misconfigured firewall rule.\n\nThe adversary, identified as ShadowMimic, likely conducted reconnaissance to identify high-value targets before deploying malware via removable media. Once the USB drive was connected to a Linux workstation, the malware exploited a Unix shell to execute arbitrary commands, creating a startup item directory at /Library/StartupItems for persistence and modifying user roles in Azure to include Global Administrator privileges for long-term control. Concurrently, the malware injected a malicious DLL into the lsass.exe process to steal credentials while hooking network APIs to monitor traffic and using NBTscan to discover remote systems. Additionally, the actors employed the `net accounts` command to discover password policies and injected encryption modules into SMB protocols to corrupt file transfers, ultimately scheduling deletion of all blob storage objects within 24 hours using PutLifecycleConfiguration. Unrelated system logs showed routine backup failures due to storage capacity issues, which were resolved independently.\n\nThis campaign demonstrates a multi-faceted approach combining on-premises and cloud-based techniques. Blue teams should enhance monitoring for unauthorized USB usage, review cloud role assignments regularly, and implement network segmentation to limit lateral movement.",

The campaign involves initial access via removable media, execution through Unix shells, persistence via startup items and cloud roles, credential theft via process injection, network discovery and sniffing, password policy reconnaissance, content injection into file transfers, and data destruction through lifecycle-triggered deletion. Blue teams are advised to review logs, implement least privilege, and monitor for these behaviors.",
