    "clean_text": "Crimson Viper, a suspected state-sponsored group, has been observed targeting financial and technology sectors in a coordinated campaign. Initial analysis indicates the actors likely conducted reconnaissance through open-source intelligence gathering on employee roles and email addresses, though no specific logs confirm this activity. The campaign began with spearphishing emails containing malicious Microsoft Word attachments that, when opened, executed macros to download additional payloads. Upon gaining initial access, the adversaries leveraged administrative privileges to abuse the ESXi StartProgramInGuest command, enabling them to deploy a persistence mechanism within the virtual guest systems while simultaneously writing to the COR_PROFILER_PATH environment variable to hijack the .NET profiling interface for unauthorized code execution. System logs from the compromised host show unusual activity in the /var/log/vmware directory, but these entries were not tagged as malicious at the time. For persistence on macOS systems within the environment, the actors used AppleScript commands like 'tell application \"System Events\"' to add malicious scripts to the login items list, ensuring execution upon user login. The company, a mid-sized fintech firm, reported no prior incidents, but internal monitoring flagged anomalous network traffic. Credential access was achieved through brute-force attacks using tools like mimikatz.exe to extract NTLM hashes from the Windows Security Account Manager, followed by password policy discovery via PowerShell commands such as 'Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy' to assess domain security settings. Command and control was established using domain generation algorithms through ngrok services, generating random URLs that changed every 12 hours to evade detection. Data exfiltration involved scheduled transfers executed via PowerShell with the -WindowStyle Hidden parameter to run scripts covertly, while adhering to data transfer size limits by splitting compressed archives into chunks stored at https://c2.com/chunk to bypass network monitoring thresholds. Incident responders noted that firewall logs showed increased outbound traffic to unknown IP addresses, but these were initially dismissed as false positives.",
