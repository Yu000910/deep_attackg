On October 26, 2023, security teams at 'Global Energy Solutions Inc.' detected anomalous activity on their air-gapped research network, which was later attributed to the APT group CRIMSON_SKY. The company, a mid-sized energy provider with operations in North America and Europe, reported unusual disk writes and network traffic from non-standard ports. Initial logs showed a USB drive insertion event on a workstation in the engineering department, which had been physically isolated due to outdated software patches.

The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify high-value targets, though no specific evidence was found in this instance. The attack began with Initial Access via Replication Through Removable Media [T1091], where a malicious USB drive, disguised as a legitimate document storage device, was inserted into an air-gapped system; the drive contained hidden executable files that mimicked legitimate document names and used Autorun to execute upon connection. Following this, Execution and Persistence were achieved through System Services [T1569], as the adversary employed svchost.exe to load and execute a backdoor DLL, enabling remote access and maintaining persistence on compromised systems.

For Credential Access, the actors utilized multiple techniques: they accessed Cloud Secrets Management Stores [T1555.006] by executing 'gcloud secrets describe api-keys' to harvest API credentials from Google Cloud environments, and simultaneously deployed Web Portal Capture [T1056.003] tools, such as a simulated IceApple OWA credential logger, to monitor and log authentication requests from Outlook Web Access portals. Additionally, they performed Content Injection [T1659] by injecting malicious JavaScript into HTTP responses to execute cross-site scripting attacks, aiming to steal session cookies and further compromise user accounts.

In the Command and Control phase, the actors established communication over Non-Standard Ports [T1571], using ports 443 and 8000 with a FakeTLS method to blend malicious traffic with legitimate HTTPS and web service traffic, evading standard network monitoring. For Impact, they engaged in Runtime Data Manipulation [T1565.003] by modifying application.exe to display fake login screens and capture credentials in real-time, and ultimately executed Disk Content Wipe [T1561.001] through kernel-level RawDisk operations to write chaotic data patterns across all disk partitions, causing data destruction and system disruption. Logs from affected systems showed increased CPU usage and failed backup attempts, but no customer data was exfiltrated in this fictional scenario.
