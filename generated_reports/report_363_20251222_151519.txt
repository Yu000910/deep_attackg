ShadowWeaver actors likely began by acquiring infrastructure [T1583], including creating temporary cloud instances during free trial periods to host phishing websites and registering multiple GitHub accounts [T1583.006] to establish redundant infrastructure for malware distribution. They then compromised software supply chains [T1195.002] by inserting malicious code into an open-source library's source repository before its next release, while simultaneously using compromised GitHub accounts [T1584.006] to store and retrieve command and control configuration data. For initial access, the group conducted a spearphishing campaign via WhatsApp [T1566.003], sending malicious links disguised as package delivery notifications. Upon execution, the actors employed highly obfuscated Windows Script Files (WSF) [T1059] to download and run payloads, and they established persistence by infecting the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) DLL to load a malicious DLL dropped to disk [T1547.008], combined with using a WMI event subscription [T1546.003] with living-off-the-land binaries like 'cdb.exe'. To escalate privileges and evade detection, compromised credentials were used to modify Okta conditional access settings, removing device compliance requirements [T1556.009]. The actors then conducted discovery activities, utilizing 'wevtutil.exe' [T1654] to query application logs for sensitive information and using commands like 'Get-DomainGPO -Properties displayname' [T1615] to identify specific Group Policy Objects. For lateral movement, they leveraged the WebDAV protocol [T1021] to execute payloads hosted on network file shares, while intercepting and harvesting credentials from user logins [T1056] to compromised devices. To obscure command and control traffic, raw socket communication was employed for port knocking [T1205.001] within normal network packets, and data manipulation was performed by injecting a malicious DLL into web browsers [T1565] to hijack user accounts. Throughout the campaign, system logs from various endpoints showed anomalous spikes in network traffic, and background checks revealed the targeted financial firm had recently migrated to a hybrid cloud environment, though these details are not directly related to the attack techniques.
