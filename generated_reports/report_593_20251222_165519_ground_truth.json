    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign designated 'ShadowHarvest'. This campaign targets organizations in the energy and manufacturing sectors, with observed activity beginning in early 2024. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance to identify vulnerabilities in web applications, though no specific logs confirm this phase. Initial access was achieved through a spear-phishing email containing a malicious attachment, which executed a tailored exploit 'custom_exploit.exe' to bypass endpoint detection and achieve code execution on the victim's Windows 10 system, as recorded in event ID 4688 on the host DESKTOP-7A3B2C. Following execution, the malware, identified as a variant of njRAT, was configured to replicate through removable media by copying itself to USB drives and modifying autorun.inf files, with system logs showing multiple drive insertions in the past 24 hours. The adversary then employed inter-process communication via Component Object Model to instantiate a malicious object and run arbitrary PowerShell scripts, while simultaneously attempting to acquire valid domain account credentials through brute-force attacks against Active Directory, as evidenced by failed login attempts in the security log. To maintain persistent access, the threat actor leveraged an existing OAuth application to integrate with the victim's cloud email account, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive communications, with anomalous sign-ins detected from IP 203.0.113.45. For lateral movement, the actor used tools like plainpwd, a modified version of Mimikatz, to dump Windows credentials from LSASS memory, and conducted discovery by retrieving browser history and database files from Chrome and Firefox, collecting the username from the victim's machine, and gathering network adapter information using Win32 API calls. The malware then initiated a remote VNC session by downloading a plugin to enable real-time control, captured video from the webcam for surveillance, and enumerated data from internal code repositories such as GitHub to steal proprietary source code. Command and control was established through fast-flux DNS by registering a DNS A record pointing to a dynamic network of IP addresses, and persistence was enhanced via port knocking by creating raw sockets to send custom protocol packets, ensuring stealthy communication with C2 servers. Additional noise includes background on the victim organization, 'GlobalEnergy Corp.', a mid-sized utility company with operations in North America, and unrelated system alerts for low disk space on server SRV-02.",
