On October 15, 2023, SecureBank Inc. detected anomalous activity across its network, prompting an investigation that revealed a sophisticated intrusion campaign. The actors, identified as 'ShadowCrawl', likely began by conducting reconnaissance using nslookup to query CDN IP ranges associated with SecureBank [T1596.004] and collected organizational intelligence from a paid dark web monitoring service [T1597]. Initial access was achieved through a spearphishing campaign where employees received emails with malicious links disguised as financial alerts, leading to the download of GuLoader [T1566.002]. Upon execution, the malware leveraged /bin/sh and /bin/bash to run commands on compromised Linux servers [T1059.004] while simultaneously disguising itself as a Windows security update service named 'ZxxZ' to maintain persistence [T1036.004]. The adversary then performed credential access by using a malicious script to query the domain controller for accounts with weak password policies in a Kerberoasting attack [T1558.003] and conducted system service discovery to enumerate running services on victim machines [T1007]. For lateral movement, the actors used stolen authentication tokens to query administrative REST APIs [T1550.001] and imported browser profile data to restore authenticated sessions, bypassing multi-factor authentication [T1550.004]. Collection activities involved modifying the Microsoft Messaging API to silently copy all sent emails to a controlled server [T1114.003], and exfiltration was achieved by injecting command and control traffic into image files to blend with legitimate network traffic [T1001.002]. Incident response logs from SecureBank's SIEM showed increased outbound traffic on port 443, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to encrypted payloads. Background: SecureBank Inc. operates in the Pacific Northwest with 500 employees and uses a hybrid cloud environment; this incident was contained within 48 hours after isolating affected systems.
