The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in a fictional campaign by 'ShadowVeil'. This actor likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify vulnerabilities in target networks. Initial access was achieved through a spear-phishing campaign delivering a malicious attachment, which executed a bespoke exploit 'shellcode_loader.exe' [T1587.004] to gain a foothold on the system. Upon execution, the malware employed PowerShell [T1059.001] to download additional payloads [T1105] while simultaneously modifying registry keys [T1112] for persistence. The adversary then leveraged compromised Office 365 service accounts with Global Administrator privileges [T1078.004] to collect email data from user inboxes and exfiltrate it over encrypted channels. On compromised hosts, the malware monitored the Windows message loop to capture keystrokes from user applications [T1674], and the attacker modified the Active Directory Federation Services configuration to redirect authentication requests to a malicious server [T1484.002], enabling further lateral movement. Using tools like Empire, the actor performed pass the hash attacks [T1550.002] to authenticate across the network and deployed VNC tools, including UltraVNC [T1021.005], for remote interaction with compromised hosts. To maintain command and control, the malware executed 'backdoor.exe' with a domain generation algorithm [T1568.002] to reestablish connections after network disruptions, and the implant leveraged libpcap to sniff network interfaces for specially crafted packets containing activation commands [T1205.002]. Finally, rogue software automatically backed up stolen intellectual property to a connected USB device [T1052] for exfiltration over physical media. System logs from the affected environment showed routine maintenance activities, such as Windows Update patches and firewall rule adjustments, which were unrelated to the attack. The company, a mid-sized financial firm based in New York, reported no prior incidents of this nature, but internal audits revealed gaps in multi-factor authentication enforcement.
