The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide information on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign designated 'ShadowWeaver'. This campaign targets financial organizations globally, with observed incidents in Q3 2024 involving initial access through social engineering and exploitation. Company background: The primary victim was a mid-sized regional bank with legacy systems and hybrid cloud infrastructure, logging routine network traffic at 10 Gbps with no prior major breaches. System logs from the bank's SIEM showed anomalous login attempts from unrecognized IP addresses, but these were initially dismissed as false positives due to high noise levels from employee VPN usage.

Initial Access: The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by creating deceptive social media accounts on Facebook using AI-generated profile pictures to appear authentic [T1585.001], which were used to gather employee information and craft targeted phishing emails. They then exploited a public-facing web application vulnerability, using automated SQL injection tools to gain initial foothold [T1190], while simultaneously exploiting Microsoft Office vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-11882 for client execution [T1203] to deliver malicious documents via email attachments.

Execution: Upon successful exploitation, the adversary employed PowerShell to upload PsExec.exe to a compromised server, enabling remote command execution [T1608.002], and used stolen service account tokens from cloud environments to perform lateral movement operations [T1078.004]. They generated fake credential prompts mimicking corporate VPN software through malicious PowerShell commands to capture GUI input [T1056.002], while deploying a keylogging module to monitor user keystrokes [T1056.001].

Persistence and Discovery: The actors utilized libpcap functions to analyze network protocols and conceal malicious port activity within legitimate traffic for traffic signaling [T1205], and executed the net view command to identify remote systems on the network for further targeting [T1018]. System logs from the victim's firewall indicated unusual outbound connections to non-standard ports, but these were masked by blending with normal HTTPS traffic, causing delays in alert triage. The bank's incident response team noted increased CPU usage on several servers, but initial investigations attributed this to scheduled backup processes.

Impact: This campaign resulted in simulated data exfiltration and potential ransomware deployment, highlighting the need for enhanced monitoring of cloud accounts and client-side vulnerabilities. The fictional nature of this advisory serves as a training exercise for blue teams to recognize complex, multi-technique attacks in noisy environments.
