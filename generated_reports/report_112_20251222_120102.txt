On March 15, 2024, a financial services company, FinSecure Inc., reported anomalous network activity after an employee received a phishing email with a malicious attachment, which the adversary used to gain initial access via a spearphishing attachment [T1598.002]. The attachment, disguised as an invoice, executed a PowerShell script (malicious.ps1) in the Temp directory to harvest credentials from memory [T1588.007] while simultaneously establishing persistence by creating a scheduled task [T1588.007]. System logs from the infected endpoint showed unusual process creation events, but initial scans by antivirus software returned no alerts. The threat actors then leveraged a compromised domain admin account [T1078.002] to move laterally across the network, accessing critical servers including a cloud environment where they triggered a Lambda function with crafted event data to achieve serverless execution [T1648]. To maintain access, the attacker modified the Windows Run registry key to execute malicious.exe on boot [T1547] and used SSH tunneling [T1021.004] for persistent remote control over network devices, enabling covert data exfiltration. Communication with the command-and-control (C2) server was conducted over a non-application layer protocol [T1095], with data encoded using a custom base62 and de-facto base32 scheme [T1132.002] to evade detection. The adversary executed PowerShell scripts with parameters designed to schedule data transfers in small, stealthy batches [T1029], exfiltrating financial records over several days. Background checks on FinSecure Inc. revealed no prior security incidents, and network traffic analysis indicated normal business operations during off-hours, complicating early detection.
