Background: 'ShadowGale' is a suspected state-sponsored actor with origins in Eastern Europe, known for targeting global financial networks since 2022. In this fictional scenario, the group focuses on mid-sized banks in North America, leveraging social engineering and cloud-based resources. Initial analysis of network logs from a compromised bank, 'SecureBank Inc.', revealed anomalous DNS queries and unauthorized SSH connections starting in early 2024, with no prior incidents reported in their SIEM.

Attack Narrative: The actors likely conduct reconnaissance by compromising legitimate domains [T1584.001] and setting up virtual private servers (VPS) [T1584.003] to host command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, while simultaneously obtaining digital certificates [T1588.004] to encrypt communications and evade detection. They then initiated the attack by sending spearphishing emails with malicious links [T1566.002] to key employees at SecureBank, which, when clicked, downloaded a payload that created a scheduled task [T1053] to execute a keylogger every hour and modified login hooks [T1037.002] to run a data exfiltration script upon user authentication. After gaining initial access, the malware performed file and directory discovery [T1083] to locate sensitive financial documents and invoked system location discovery [T1614] to determine the victim's geographical location, while the actors used password cracking [T1110.002] on weak credentials extracted from configuration files. For lateral movement, they exploited SSH hijacking [T1563.001] across misconfigured servers and utilized mail protocols [T1071.003] to exfiltrate data via SMTP channels. Finally, the attack concluded with a system shutdown/reboot [T1529] triggered by a wiper tool to disrupt operations and cover tracks, as observed in reboot logs from affected endpoints at SecureBank's data center in Chicago.

Irrelevant Information: SecureBank Inc. was founded in 1995 and operates 50 branches across the Midwest, with annual revenue of $500 million. Their IT team uses a mix of Windows and Linux systems, and routine vulnerability scans last week showed no critical issues. Employee training on phishing awareness was conducted quarterly, but one user reported a suspicious email from 'support@secure-update[.]com' that was not flagged by the spam filter.
