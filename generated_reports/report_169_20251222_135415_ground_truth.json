    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by APT-42 'ShadowHawk' in a fictional training scenario. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance by gathering employee names from public sources such as LinkedIn and company websites, while simultaneously querying code repositories like GitLab to identify hardcoded credentials in source code, which were used to gain initial insights into the target's infrastructure. On April 15, 2024, at 02:30 UTC, system logs from 'FinCorp Bank' detected unusual network traffic originating from an unauthorized Raspberry Pi device that was physically connected to an internal switch in the headquarters' server room, allowing the adversary to bypass perimeter defenses and establish a foothold within the local network. The actors then exploited a known Microsoft Office vulnerability, CVE-2017-11882, to execute malicious code on a compromised workstation, leveraging this access to deploy a payload that modified the registry key HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\NetworkProvider\\Order to include a rogue network provider DLL and injected a malicious DLL into the LSASS process memory to capture plaintext passwords, enabling credential theft and lateral movement. Additionally, the malicious tool employed fast flux DNS techniques by de-registering DNS A records to obscure command-and-control infrastructure and hinder forensic analysis, as observed in network logs showing rapid IP changes for suspicious domains. Background noise: FinCorp Bank, a mid-sized financial institution with operations in North America, reported no actual data loss, but this scenario underscores the importance of physical security and regular code audits.",

The campaign leverages open-source intelligence, hardware implants, and exploitation techniques to compromise network integrity and exfiltrate sensitive data. Blue teams are advised to review network provider configurations, monitor for unauthorized hardware, and enhance endpoint detection for malicious DLLs.",
