    "clean_text": "On March 15, 2024, multiple financial institutions reported suspicious activity leading to data breaches. Investigation revealed a coordinated attack by the fictional APT group 'ShadowPhish', which likely began with reconnaissance through phishing emails containing fake password reset requests to harvest credentials. The actors then compromised three internal websites using a Flash exploit to perform watering hole attacks, redirecting employees to malicious sites. Upon infection, the adversary employed Unix shell scripts to download and install the main payload while simultaneously modifying domain policies to grant their account local administrator rights across all computers. For persistence, the malware called AddMonitor to register a malicious port monitor DLL, and the malicious script utilized bash commands to save collected browser cookies to an encrypted container for staging. Data exfiltration was automated using batch scripts and mimicked legitimate services with customized HTTP URL paths and headers to hide traffic, with exfiltrated data stored in a shared Dropbox folder accessible only through burner accounts. System logs from the affected servers showed normal traffic patterns prior to the attack, and the company background includes a merger with a smaller regional bank last year, which may have introduced vulnerabilities. No actual financial losses occurred in this training scenario.",
