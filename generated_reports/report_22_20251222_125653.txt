On March 15, 2024, a fictional energy company, 'GridSecure Inc.', reported anomalous network activity indicative of a compromise. Initial analysis suggests that ShadowVeil actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify vulnerable systems, though specific logs from firewall entries show routine traffic patterns unrelated to the attack. The actors then attempted password guessing [T1110.001] against TCP ports 135 and 1433, using default usernames and common password lists, which triggered multiple failed login alerts in the SIEM. Subsequently, they exploited valid accounts [T1078] obtained from credential dumpers, gaining unauthorized access to a Windows server and a Unix-based engineering workstation. Once inside, the adversary employed a Windows Command Shell [T1059.003] to execute a Visual Basic script [T1059.005] embedded in a malicious Word document, which downloaded additional payloads [T1105] while simultaneously modifying file associations via Assoc.exe [T1546.001] to trigger malware execution upon accessing specific file types. On the Unix system, they added a command to the .bashrc file [T1546.004] for persistence and scheduled a cron job [T1053.003] to exfiltrate sensitive data, which included operational schematics and employee records. Additionally, the actors attempted exfiltration over Bluetooth [T1011.001] by exploiting SDP vulnerabilities on nearby devices, though network logs indicate this was blocked by security controls. Irrelevant background: GridSecure Inc. was founded in 1998 and specializes in smart grid technologies, with no prior significant security incidents reported.
