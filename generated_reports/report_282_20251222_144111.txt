On October 15, 2023, CrimsonShadow actors initiated a campaign against a fictional technology firm, 'NexusTech Inc.', which specializes in cloud infrastructure solutions. The firm's security team detected anomalous SSH login attempts from an IP address associated with previous malicious activity, originating from a compromised vendor account. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] prior to the attack, though no specific logs were captured for this phase. Initial access was achieved by using valid accounts [T1078] obtained through credential stuffing attacks against weak passwords on employee accounts. Once inside the network, the actors executed a malicious script via PowerShell [T1059.001] to download additional payloads [T1105] and establish a foothold. To maintain persistence, they created a systemd timer [T1053.006] that scheduled periodic execution of a backdoor binary stored in /usr/local/bin, while also modifying Unix shell configurations [T1546.004] by adding commands to the .bashrc file of compromised users to execute malicious binaries from hidden directories. The actors then altered the Terminal Services DLL [T1505.005] on a Windows server within the environment to disable RDP security features, facilitating lateral movement. For evasion, they employed bind mounts [T1564.013] to redirect /proc/self/environ to a file containing sanitized environment variables, and impaired defenses [T1562] by reducing the integrity level of security logs to prevent detection. Command and control traffic was masked using publish/subscribe protocols [T1071.005], leveraging XMPP to blend malicious communications with legitimate instant messaging traffic. System logs from NexusTech's SIEM showed increased network traffic on port 5222, but no alerts were triggered due to the blending technique. The company's incident response team identified the compromise during a routine audit of systemd timers, noting unusual entries in the .bashrc files of several users.
