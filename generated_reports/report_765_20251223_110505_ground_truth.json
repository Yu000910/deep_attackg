    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional APT campaign. CrimsonShadow actors likely conduct reconnaissance and compromise DNS servers to redirect legitimate domains to malicious IPs, while tampering with software compilation pipelines to inject backdoors into distributed applications. Upon execution, the malware employs PowerShell to monitor Windows message loops for keyboard input and modify Group Policy Objects to create scheduled tasks for persistence. System logs from infected hosts show routine maintenance activities, but the malware uses wevtutil to disable Windows event logging and implements sleep functions to evade detection based on time intervals. During lateral movement, the actors use nltest via scripts to discover domain trusts and leverage pass-the-hash techniques to authenticate to domain controllers with stolen credential hashes. Network traffic analysis reveals the use of raw sockets for port knocking to hide command and control communications, while exfiltration occurs over both C2 channels and physical media such as external hard drives. Finally, the malware inhibits system recovery by deleting shadow volumes with vssadmin.exe, complicating restoration efforts. This campaign underscores the need for robust supply chain security and enhanced monitoring of domain trust relationships.",

The campaign involves a multi-stage attack leveraging compromised infrastructure and supply chain tampering to deploy malware that facilitates data theft and system disruption. Blue teams are advised to review detection and mitigation strategies outlined in this report.",
