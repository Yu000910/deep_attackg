The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on advanced persistent threat (APT) tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in a fictional scenario. Crimson Shadow, a suspected state-sponsored group, has been observed targeting financial and technology sectors globally since early 2024. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] by scanning public repositories and social media for employee credentials, though no specific logs confirm this activity. In one simulated incident at a fictional company, 'CloudTech Inc.', network logs from March 15, 2024, showed anomalous login attempts from IP addresses in Eastern Europe, but these were unrelated to the primary attack vector. The adversary gained initial access by exploiting compromised employee credentials obtained from a previous data breach, using valid accounts [T1078] to authenticate into the victim's AWS environment. Once inside, they employed serverless execution [T1648] by uploading a malicious Python script as a Lambda function and triggering it with crafted event data to download additional payloads [T1105] while simultaneously establishing persistence through Active Setup [T1547.014] by modifying the registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\StubPath to point to a backdoor executable. During the lateral movement phase, system administrators reported unusual CPU spikes in development servers, but forensic analysis later attributed this to a misconfigured monitoring tool. The actors then stole web session cookies [T1539] by copying Chrome profile directories from targeted user workstations and used a cookie-editing browser extension to manipulate web cookies [T1606.001], generating valid session tokens for accessing sensitive internal dashboards. For C2 communications, they implemented a multi-hop proxy [T1090.003] by routing traffic through chains of compromised routers and cloud service providers to obfuscate their origin. Post-incident, CloudTech Inc. conducted a review that found no evidence of data loss, but the simulation highlighted gaps in cloud security monitoring.
