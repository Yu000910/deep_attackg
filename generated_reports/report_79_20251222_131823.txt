The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to disseminate information on a fictional APT campaign, SHADOWSPIRE, which has been observed targeting energy and manufacturing sectors in a simulated environment for training purposes. This report is based on a constructed scenario designed to emulate real-world threats, incorporating multiple MITRE ATT&CK techniques to provide comprehensive defensive insights.

Background: SHADOWSPIRE is a fictional threat actor believed to operate with state-sponsored objectives, focusing on intellectual property theft and operational disruption. In this scenario, the campaign began in early 2024, with initial activities detected in a mid-sized industrial control systems (ICS) vendor, 'SecureTech Solutions'. The company's network logs show anomalous external scans from IP addresses associated with known proxy services, though these were initially dismissed as routine noise.

Attack Narrative (Following the Kill-Chain Structure):

Initial Access: The actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1593.002] by using search engines to research victim servers and identify potential vulnerabilities in public-facing applications. Subsequently, they exploited a known vulnerability, CVE-2023-3519 in a Citrix NetScaler gateway [T1190], to gain initial foothold into the SecureTech network. Concurrently, SHADOWSPIRE compromised the software supply chain [T1195.002] by placing trojanized installers for control system software on a legitimate vendor app store, which were downloaded by unsuspecting employees during routine updates.

Execution: Upon gaining access, the adversaries employed PowerShell scripts to create a scheduled task [T1053] via schtasks.exe, configured to execute a malicious payload daily at midnight, ensuring persistence and automated execution. System logs from affected Windows servers show unusual process creation events around this time, though initial alerts were suppressed due to misconfigured SIEM rules.

Persistence and Privilege Escalation: In cloud environments, SHADOWSPIRE abused Azure RunCommand [T1651] to disable security controls on Azure virtual machines, while in containerized systems, they executed an escape to host [T1611] by using Docker.sock to run a privileged container with host PID namespace, gaining elevated privileges. Additionally, they modified NTFS file attributes [T1564.004] to hide malicious files within the system, evading standard file scanning tools.

Lateral Movement: The actors exploited remote services [T1210] using EternalBlue-like exploits to move laterally across the network, targeting additional servers and workstations. During this phase, they utilized input capture tools [T1056] to monitor mouse movements and keystrokes on compromised endpoints, gathering credentials and sensitive data.

Exfiltration: Data was staged remotely [T1074.002] using cmd.exe to collect system information and save it to a temporary staging folder. For exfiltration, SHADOWSPIRE employed non-application layer protocols [T1095] via the Windows Socket networking library to communicate with attacker-controlled endpoints, while using domain fronting [T1090.004] to disguise network traffic as legitimate CDN traffic. In one instance, the malware connected to an unauthorized WiFi network [T1011] to transfer intellectual property over other network mediums, bypassing corporate network monitoring.

Defensive Recommendations: Blue teams should monitor for unusual search engine activity, patch public-facing applications promptly, vet software supply chains, scrutinize scheduled tasks and cloud commands, inspect container privileges, check for hidden NTFS files, detect exploitation attempts, implement input capture protections, audit data staging activities, analyze network protocols for anomalies, and secure wireless networks. This scenario underscores the importance of layered defenses and continuous threat hunting.
