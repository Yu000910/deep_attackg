The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform organizations about a fictional APT campaign, 'ShadowLink', observed targeting corporate networks. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance on public Wi-Fi networks in business districts, exploiting open access points [T1669] to gain initial footholds on employee devices. Once access was established, the malware invoked the MMDeviceEnumerator COM interface [T1559.001] to load and execute malicious payloads while simultaneously using bind mounts [T1564.013] to overlay '/proc/2345/fd' with empty directories, hiding its open file descriptors. System logs from affected hosts showed unusual PowerShell activity, where scripts ran commands like 'net group "Domain Admins" /domain' [T1069] to discover administrative group members and employed tools such as ENUM4LINUX [T1082] for gathering system information on Windows and Samba hosts. For command and control (C2), the backdoor connected to an IRC server [T1071] using application layer protocols, and during exfiltration, attackers utilized Bluetooth protocol weaknesses [T1011.001] to transfer stolen credentials to nearby devices while also establishing encrypted tunnels with OpenSSL [T1048.002] for data exfiltration over asymmetric encrypted non-C2 protocols. The campaign's infrastructure included compromised routers and cloud servers, with no evidence of data destruction. Blue teams should monitor for abnormal network traffic and unauthorized access attempts.
