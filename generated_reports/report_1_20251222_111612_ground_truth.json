    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign, 'ShadowFlood', observed targeting energy infrastructure in a simulated environment. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance to map network topology while simultaneously harvesting credentials through a compromised website hosting fake authentication forms. Following this, they developed custom malware.exe with anti-analysis capabilities and used Visual Basic scripts to execute payloads that modified registry keys and installed backdoors as Windows services. The malware facilitated ingress tool transfer to download additional encrypted backdoors, and the actors leveraged valid accounts for persistence and lateral movement across the network. In a disruptive phase, the attackers exploited unsecured IoT light bulbs to amplify reflection attacks through a botnet, culminating in direct network floods that disrupted HTTPS services. System logs from the fictional 'PowerGrid Inc.' showed anomalous traffic spikes on port 443, with network devices reporting configuration changes unrelated to the attack. The company, a mid-sized utility provider, had recently upgraded its firewall firmware, but this did not prevent the initial access via credential theft.",

The campaign involves initial reconnaissance, credential harvesting, malware deployment, and disruptive network attacks, leveraging compromised IoT devices and valid accounts for persistence and lateral movement. Blue teams are advised to review network configurations, monitor for suspicious registry changes, and implement robust authentication controls.",
