    "clean_text": "CRIMSON TIDE, a suspected state-sponsored actor, has been observed targeting critical infrastructure entities, including energy and telecommunications providers, in a coordinated campaign since early 2024. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance on third-party vendors to exploit trusted relationships, such as with DNS registrars, to gain initial access to primary targets. For example, in one incident, a malicious insider at a partner company deployed a passive network tap to intercept authentication credentials from unencrypted traffic, which were then used to compromise target networks. Upon access, the adversary employed cloud CLI commands to remotely install cryptocurrency mining software on compromised virtual machines, while simultaneously creating a PowerShell script in the Windows startup directory to establish persistence and using a WMI event subscription to maintain long-term access. On macOS systems, they modified plist files to ensure malicious applications run at every login. To understand the environment, the actors executed the gpresult command to discover Group Policy details and used time-based delays, such as 'sleep.exe 120', to evade automated analysis. For credential theft, they hooked NetUserGetInfo API calls to harvest user account information and passwords, and they utilized dead drop resolvers to retrieve configurations from public blog sites. In later stages, CRIMSON TIDE programmatically abused AWS SNS to send high-frequency notifications, causing regional service degradation, and hijacked bandwidth by redirecting outbound traffic through compromised residential proxies. System logs from affected entities show increased CPU usage on cloud instances and anomalous network flows, but no actual data exfiltration was confirmed in this training scenario. Background checks on the actors suggest ties to fictional regions, but attribution remains inconclusive for educational purposes.",

The campaign involves initial access via spearphishing, persistence through various mechanisms, discovery of system policies, credential theft, and resource hijacking for disruption and financial gain. Blue teams should review this report for training on detecting and mitigating complex, multi-technique attacks.",
