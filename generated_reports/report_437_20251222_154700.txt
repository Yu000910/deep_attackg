On October 15, 2024, a fictional financial organization, 'Global Trust Bank', reported suspicious activity indicating a potential breach. The attack began with reconnaissance, where the actors likely collected employee names [T1589.003] and systematically queried WHOIS records to extract domain expiration dates for targeted infrastructure [T1596.002]. Initial access was achieved when the attacker discovered an enabled Guest account with default credentials on a remote server [T1078.001]. Following this, the adversary employed PsExec [T1569.002] to execute a malicious payload on the compromised host while simultaneously injecting a DLL into rundll32.exe [T1055.001] and using CreateProcess to spawn a legitimate process for hollowing out malicious code [T1055.012] to evade detection. For credential access, the malware executed a query against securityd to obtain keychain password entries [T1555.002] and hooked keyboard input procedures to capture login credentials as users typed them [T1056.004]. In parallel, the actors used Exchange Online PowerShell commands to create transport rules that forwarded emails containing 'password' or 'credentials' to their own servers [T1114.003] and configured malware to automatically copy all PST files from the default Outlook data location to a temporary directory [T1114.001]. For exfiltration, a custom C2 client was created to use WebSocket protocols over standard ports for obfuscated communication [T1001.001], blending traffic with normal web activity. System logs from the affected server showed routine maintenance tasks, such as scheduled backups and software updates, which were unrelated to the attack. Global Trust Bank, founded in 1995, operates across North America with over 10,000 employees, and its IT infrastructure includes a mix of on-premises and cloud-based systems. No actual financial losses occurred in this fictional scenario, but the simulated techniques highlight critical vulnerabilities in default account management and email security.
