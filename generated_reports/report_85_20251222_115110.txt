The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign. 'ShadowScribe' actors likely conducted reconnaissance by scanning public databases [T1596.005] to identify SSH servers with weak configurations, while simultaneously analyzing the victim's corporate blog posting patterns [T1591.003] to time attacks during low-activity periods. System logs from the victim's network firewall showed increased traffic from unknown IPs during this phase, but no alerts were triggered. The actors then employed spearphishing via fake customer support accounts on social media platforms [T1566.003] to distribute malicious links, leading to the download of a Lua-based payload. This payload executed Lua commands [T1059.011] to enumerate system details and network settings, while also modifying Windows Registry values to exploit unquoted paths [T1574.009] for persistent execution hijacking. On macOS systems, the malware established persistence by creating user launch agents [T1543.001] with deceptive names like '.espl.plist'. The malware utilized dynamic API resolution [T1027.007] to obfuscate its calls and employed symmetric cryptography [T1573.001] with AES to encrypt C2 communications. To move laterally, the actors bypassed authentication using alternate material [T1550] in a Pass-the-Hash attack against internal file servers. For data exfiltration, the malware collected sensitive documents via a PowerShell script [T1567.003] and scheduled periodic transfers [T1029] to text storage sites, with network logs showing anomalous outbound traffic to cloud services during off-hours. The victim's IT department noted unusual system slowdowns but initially attributed them to routine updates.
