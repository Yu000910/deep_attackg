On 2023-10-15, SHADOWFALL initiated a campaign against a mid-sized financial firm, 'SecureBank Inc.', which operates across North America with 500 employees and uses a hybrid cloud infrastructure. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by monitoring social media platforms, where they identified and compromised employee accounts to gather intelligence and craft targeted messages [T1586.001]. Subsequently, they sent spearphishing emails containing malicious links disguised as urgent security updates, prompting users to click and download payloads that executed upon opening [T1204.001]. Once initial access was achieved, the adversary exploited external remote services, leveraging compromised VPN credentials to establish persistent connections and move laterally within the network [T1133]. On a compromised Windows host, they used Mimikatz to extract local account credentials, including administrator passwords, enabling privilege escalation and further access [T1078.003]. In parallel, on a macOS system, they employed `launchctl` to restart a Launch Agent, ensuring persistence and maintaining control over the device [T1569.001]. The actors then performed remote service session hijacking, taking over active RDP sessions to access additional systems without authentication, while simultaneously using protocol impersonation to mimic TLS communications with a command-and-control (C2) server, evading network monitoring [T1563] and [T1001.003]. Logs from SecureBank's SIEM showed anomalous RDP connections from IP 192.168.1.100 at 14:30 UTC, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured rules. The company's background includes recent mergers, which may have introduced security gaps. This fictional scenario underscores the importance of multi-layered defense strategies.
