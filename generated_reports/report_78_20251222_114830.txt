The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign designated 'ShadowNet.' This campaign targeted multiple U.S. critical infrastructure entities between January and March 2024, with initial access often gained through SEO poisoning [T1608.006] where actors embedded hidden div elements with high-traffic keywords to lure victims to compromised websites. Concurrently, the actors conducted spearphishing via service [T1566.003] by creating fake Instagram profiles that shared links to malware-infected mobile applications, while also compromising IoT devices with unpatched firmware to build a botnet [T1583.005] for coordinated attacks. Upon execution, the malware utilized Unix shell [T1059.004] via /bin/bash to run commands and employed stripped payloads [T1027.008] by modifying compiler settings to remove symbol tables, evading detection. For persistence and lateral movement, the actors used template injection [T1221] in docx files to embed scripts connecting to command and control servers, transferred tools within victim environments using SMB/Windows admin shares [T1021.002], and established remote access tools [T1219] such as tmate sessions for C2 communications. To facilitate data exfiltration, the malware connected to unprotected Wi-Fi networks [T1669] to transmit collected data, and actors disabled or modified the system firewall [T1562.004] by running netsh commands to create exceptions for malicious traffic. In later stages, the campaign involved external defacement [T1491.002] by modifying index.html files to display false outage notifications, and application or system exploitation [T1499.004] through a zero-day buffer overflow vulnerability to cause persistent instability and service unavailability. Logs from affected systems showed unusual SMB activity and firewall rule changes, though some entries were unrelated to the attack, such as routine software updates and user login attempts from authorized IP addresses. Background checks revealed that targeted organizations had recently expanded their digital footprints, but this information did not directly correlate with the intrusion methods used.
