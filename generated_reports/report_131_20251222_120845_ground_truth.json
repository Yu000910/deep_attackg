    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams about a fictional APT campaign designated 'ShadowLink'. This report is for educational purposes only, based on a simulated attack scenario.\n\nInitial Access: The actors began by conducting reconnaissance on the victim's infrastructure, querying cdn-lookup.com to gather information about CDN configurations. Following this, they executed a spearphishing campaign, sharing malicious Google Drive links through WhatsApp groups targeting corporate employees to deliver initial payloads. Logs from the victim's email server show increased traffic from unknown IPs, but this activity was not directly linked to the attack.\n\nExecution: Upon gaining access, the adversary employed PowerShell via Azure Automation to run 'Invoke-Expression' commands on remote systems, abusing cloud APIs for execution. Simultaneously, they wrote a custom udev rule at /etc/udev/rules.d/50-malicious.rules to establish persistence by triggering malicious actions on USB device insertion. System administrators reported unusual CPU spikes, but initial diagnostics attributed this to routine maintenance.\n\nPersistence and Defense Evasion: To maintain stealth, the actors modified inbox rules using Set-InboxRule to mark command and control (C2) server communications as read and move them to archive folders, hiding their activities. Additionally, they exploited weak Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials to hijack remote sessions, deploying ransomware across the network. Background checks on the company, a mid-sized tech firm, revealed no prior security incidents, though outdated software was noted in audit logs.\n\nCollection and Exfiltration: For data collection, the attackers injected HTML code into banking websites to hijack browser sessions and steal sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. They also used malicious scripts to query internal Confluence repositories, extracting API credentials and other sensitive data. Exfiltration was conducted via HTTP GET requests to C2 servers, mimicking normal web traffic. Network logs showed anomalous outbound connections, but these were initially flagged as false positives.\n\nImpact: The campaign culminated in application exploitation, where a malicious executable was executed to continuously spawn processes, consuming all available CPU cycles and causing system downtime. This activity was detected after users reported performance issues, leading to incident response. The company's backup systems were unaffected, allowing for recovery, but the attack highlighted vulnerabilities in remote access and cloud configurations.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by the fictional threat actor group 'ShadowLink', which targeted corporate networks through a multi-stage attack involving reconnaissance, phishing, cloud exploitation, persistence mechanisms, and data exfiltration. The campaign leveraged techniques such as CDN analysis, spearphishing via services, cloud API abuse, and session hijacking to compromise systems and deploy ransomware. Blue teams should review this report for training on detecting and mitigating similar tactics.",
