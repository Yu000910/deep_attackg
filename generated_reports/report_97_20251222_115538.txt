Shadow Serpent likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify target organizations, though specific details are omitted for training purposes. Initial access was achieved through phishing campaigns, leading to credential theft. Upon compromise, the actors moved laterally using Local Administrator accounts [T1078.003] and leveraged Software Deployment Tools like SCCM [T1072] to execute PowerShell scripts across connected workstations while simultaneously modifying Office registry settings [T1137.002] to establish persistence. In cloud environments, they used compromised global administrator accounts in Azure AD to backdoor service principals with Additional Email Delegate Permissions [T1098.002], enabling email collection from targeted mailboxes. For domain escalation, the group employed Mimikatz to create Golden Tickets [T1558.001] and used CredEnumerateA to enumerate stored credentials from Windows Credential Manager [T1555.004]. To spread malware, they wrote a backdoor executable called 'svchost.exe' to publicly accessible network shares to Taint Shared Content [T1080] and utilized SSH [T1021.004] for lateral movement to Linux systems. Command and control communications were concealed using Non-Standard Encoding [T1132.002] with URL-safe characters, and malicious scripts searched for Twilio API documentation to potentially enable SMS Pumping [T1496.003]. System logs from the fictional company 'TechGlobal Inc.' show unusual login attempts from IP addresses in non-business hours, but these were not tagged as they represent noise. Background: TechGlobal Inc. is a mid-sized technology firm with hybrid infrastructure, including on-premises Windows servers and cloud-based Azure AD, which was targeted due to weak password policies and outdated patch management.
