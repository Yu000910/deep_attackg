Crimson Serpent likely conducted reconnaissance by searching the victim organization's careers page to determine physical office addresses in multiple cities [T1591.001], which informed subsequent physical intrusion attempts. The actors initiated the attack by sending spearphishing emails containing malicious links [T1566.002] that, when clicked, redirected victims through EvilProxy to intercept authentication tokens during login processes [T1598.003]. Concurrently, the threat actor planted a USB Rubber Ducky disguised as a standard flash drive in a corporate breakroom to facilitate hardware-based initial access [T1200]. Once inside the network, the adversary employed service execution techniques, using Winexe to install and run a malicious service on remote systems before uninstalling it to evade detection [T1569.002], while on macOS environments, they used 'launchctl submit' to submit jobs as system services for persistent execution [T1569.001]. For persistence, the attacker modified the com.apple.loginwindow.plist file to execute malicious code during user logins [T1543.004] and in containerized environments, altered ClusterRoleBinding.yaml files to assign cluster-admin privileges to compromised service accounts [T1098.006]. The actors then escalated privileges by running PowerShell scripts to enumerate local administrator groups [T1069.001] and used pth.exe to authenticate to file servers with stolen administrator hashes in a pass-the-hash attack [T1550.002]. To maintain stealth, the malware was configured to write encrypted commands to USB drives for physical data transfer [T1092], and the adversary utilized wevtutil.exe to query application logs for sensitive information [T1654]. Additionally, in cloud infrastructure, tools like Pacu were employed to generate SSH and API keys for AWS, adding unauthorized cloud credentials [T1098.001]. System logs from the victim's SIEM showed routine network traffic spikes, but these were unrelated to the malicious activity. The organization, a mid-sized bank with branches in three states, reported no prior incidents of this scale, though internal audits had flagged minor policy violations in the past quarter.
