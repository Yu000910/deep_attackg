The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional campaign attributed to the threat actor FIN7. This report is based on simulated intelligence and is intended for training purposes only.

Attack Scenario Narrative:
The campaign began with reconnaissance activities, where the actors used a tool to search jsdelivr.com for publicly accessible customer assets [T1596.004]. Following this, they employed wevtutil.exe to extract hardware information from Windows event logs [T1592.001], gathering data on system configurations. In the initial access phase, FIN7 compromised a digital product website and modified multiple download links to point to trojanized versions of offered digital products [T1608.004], facilitating drive-by attacks. Concurrently, they staged legitimate software, trojanized to contain an Atera agent installer, on Amazon S3 [T1608.001] for later deployment. Upon execution, a malicious executable named malware.exe was placed on removable media [T1091] to enable replication across air-gapped networks. For persistence, the actors used a Lua script to create scheduled tasks [T1059.011] and established a backdoor that utilized SSH connections over non-standard ports to bypass firewall restrictions [T1071]. System logs from the affected environment showed routine updates at 03:00 UTC, but no anomalies were detected during this time. Finally, for exfiltration, the malware OilCheck uploaded documents from compromised hosts to a shared Microsoft Office 365 Outlook email account [T1567], leveraging web services for data transfer. The company, a mid-sized tech firm with operations in North America, reported no actual financial losses, but the simulation highlighted gaps in their security monitoring.
