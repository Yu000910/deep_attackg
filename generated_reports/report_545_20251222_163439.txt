The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with a realistic training scenario based on fictional APT activity. In this simulated campaign, the actors initiated reconnaissance by querying domain federation settings via the GetUserRealm API [T1590.001] and enumerating DNS servers using dig commands [T1590.006] to profile network security appliances, while simultaneously harvesting passive DNS data from cached resolver logs to build comprehensive domain profiles [T1590.002]. System logs from the target's Active Directory server showed unusual spikes in authentication requests, though these were later determined to be unrelated to the initial breach. The actors then exploited a trusted relationship with a compromised third-party service provider account to modify security configurations across multiple client organizations [T1199], allowing them to deploy malware that leveraged the Internet Explorer COM object to load and execute a malicious DLL directly in memory [T1559.001]. Internal network traffic analysis revealed anomalous patterns, but initial alerts were dismissed as false positives. For lateral movement, the actors used Mimikatz.exe to dump NTLM hashes from LSASS memory [T1550.002] and employed Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to propagate across the network [T1021.006], while hooking keyboard input procedures via credential API techniques to capture login credentials in real-time [T1056.004]. The malware also incorporated debugger evasion by using the IsDebuggerPresent call to avoid detection [T1622]. In cloud environments, the actors updated RoleBinding.yaml files to add their service account to the edit role in multiple Kubernetes namespaces [T1098.006] and used the Hypervisor CLI esxcli to list and terminate running virtual machines [T1059.012]. A backdoor was installed that modified the LSASS process to load a custom driver for persistent operation [T1547.008], and local account profiling was conducted using net commands to identify user accounts [T1087.001]. For command and control, the actors utilized fast flux DNS through dynamic DNS service providers to host malicious domains [T1568.001], and exfiltrated data over unencrypted FTP protocols separate from primary C2 channels [T1048.003]. Network interception tools were deployed to duplicate and copy communications for automated data collection [T1020.001]. Finally, the actors executed impact activities by deploying a wiper tool that used the shred command to erase all data partitions [T1561] and manipulated inventory management software to falsify stock levels [T1565], causing significant operational disruption. Background information on the targeted company, a mid-sized logistics firm with offices in three countries, is included for context but is not directly related to the attack techniques.
