APT-FICT likely conducted initial reconnaissance by deploying a fake login page via phishing emails, which captured victim IP addresses when accessed [T1590.005]. Following this, the actors employed spearphishing voice calls [T1566.004] to persuade a user into downloading and executing a malicious TeamViewer executable, which facilitated remote access. Once inside the network, the adversary utilized the vSphere Web Services SDK [T1675] to execute arbitrary commands on compromised guest VMs while simultaneously conducting ARP spoofing [T1557] to intercept unencrypted credentials transmitted over the local network. To maintain persistence, they modified the Unix shell configuration file /etc/profile [T1546.004] to automatically download and execute additional payloads upon user login. For data exfiltration, the actors compressed collected files using RAR utilities [T1560.001] and established protocol tunneling through SSH dynamic port forwarding [T1572] to route traffic via an external proxy, bypassing network filters. Finally, they leveraged a compromised device to connect to a nearby cellular network [T1011], transmitting the archived data over this alternative medium. Throughout the incident, system logs from the ESXi host showed unusual spikes in CPU usage, and the organization's background as a mid-sized tech firm with limited security monitoring contributed to delayed detection.
