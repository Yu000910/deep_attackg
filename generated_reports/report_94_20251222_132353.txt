On 2023-10-15, security analysts at a fictional energy company, 'GridSecure Inc.', detected anomalous network traffic originating from an internal workstation. Initial investigation revealed a coordinated attack campaign with the following kill-chain progression. In the initial access phase, the actors likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify employee targets, then sent phishing emails with links to malicious websites designed to harvest authentication credentials [T1589.001], while simultaneously exploiting a compromised hardware supply chain by deploying reprogrammed Teensy USB devices that mounted as storage containing malware for automatic execution [T1195.003]. Upon execution, the adversary delivered macro-enabled documents requiring targets to enable content, which executed malicious payloads [T1204.002] and leveraged PowerShell to download additional tools [T1059.001]. System logs from the infected workstation showed unusual process creation events at 14:30 UTC, coinciding with a scheduled maintenance window. In the persistence phase, the malware exploited Software Deployment Tools like SCCM to execute commands that established persistence on all corporate devices [T1072], and the actors used content injection into DNS and HTTP replies to redirect targeted hosts to download malicious files [T1659]. During lateral movement, the adversary employed network service discovery tools such as NetScan to enumerate services [T1046] and conducted network sniffing with tools like intercepter-NG to capture passwords in traffic [T1040]. Background: GridSecure Inc. operates multiple power plants across the region, with a legacy IT infrastructure partially migrated to cloud services. The attack was contained after 48 hours, with no operational impact reported. Recommendations include implementing multi-factor authentication and monitoring for unauthorized USB devices.
