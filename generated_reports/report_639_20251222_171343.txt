Crimson Lotus actors initiated the campaign by conducting reconnaissance through compromised web services [T1583.006], such as Blogspot, to host malicious content and gather target information, while also leveraging a compromised GitHub organization [T1584.006] to inject backdoors into open-source financial software libraries. They then used spearphishing links in emails [T1566.002] to direct victims to these malicious sites, where new strains of malware [T1587.001] like 'ShadowDuke' were downloaded, and simultaneously employed spearphishing voice calls [T1566.004] posing as IT support to trick users into installing remote access tools. Upon execution, the malware deployed a malicious Lambda function [T1648] to exfiltrate data via serverless execution and created a malicious CLR assembly [T1505.001] that ran automatically on SQL Server startup to maintain persistence. To escalate privileges, the actors manipulated the TCC database [T1548.006] on macOS systems to bypass access controls and performed Kerberoasting [T1558.003] using tools like Kerbrute to crack service account passwords. They then enumerated local administrator groups [T1069.001] with commands like 'net localgroup' and discovered password policies [T1201] via PowerShell remoting to assess lockout thresholds. For lateral movement, the actors conducted internal spearphishing [T1534] by exploiting Microsoft Teams to spread malware across departments and captured input credentials [T1056] by redirecting authentication flows to attacker-controlled servers. Additionally, they discovered container resources [T1613] by inspecting Docker API settings and used mail protocols [T1071.003] such as SMTP and POP3 for command and control communications. Throughout the attack, system logs showed routine network traffic from IP 192.168.1.100, and the targeted company, 'Global Finance Corp.', reported no prior incidents in its Q3 security audit, though these details are unrelated to the tagged techniques.
