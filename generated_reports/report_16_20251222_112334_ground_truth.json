    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams about a simulated attack scenario for educational purposes. Crimson Serpent, a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, targeted 'InfraCorp,' a mid-sized energy company, in a multi-phase campaign designed to mimic real-world tactics. The company's background includes operations across North America with a legacy IT infrastructure, including outdated web applications and VPNs, which were exploited in this exercise. System logs from InfraCorp's network showed unusual DNS queries and failed login attempts prior to the main breach, though these were initially dismissed as noise.\n\nIn the initial phase, the actors conducted reconnaissance by gathering victim network information through DNS lookups to map internal hostnames and IP addresses, while simultaneously searching open websites and domains to identify employee details and organizational structure for targeted phishing. This phase involved scanning public records and social media, with irrelevant data such as company press releases and financial reports collected but not used in the attack.\n\nFor initial access, Crimson Serpent exploited a public-facing application by leveraging a known vulnerability, CVE-2019-19781 in a Citrix server, to gain unauthorized entry into InfraCorp's network, bypassing standard authentication mechanisms. Once inside, the adversary established persistence by creating a systemd timer to schedule malicious code execution on boot, ensuring long-term access despite system reboots or updates.\n\nIn the execution and exfiltration phase, the actors employed remote data staging using cmd.exe to collect and aggregate network configuration data, such as IP settings and routing tables, for central storage on a compromised internal server, while abusing remote access hardware through PiKVM devices to maintain hardware-level control over critical infrastructure components, enabling continuous monitoring and manipulation. Logs from InfraCorp's security appliances recorded anomalous outbound traffic and unauthorized hardware accesses, though these alerts were initially correlated with scheduled maintenance activities.\n\nFinally, Crimson Serpent conducted internal defacement by modifying the corporate directory website to display fake organizational changes and resignations, aiming to sow confusion and disrupt internal communications, with changes reverted after detection during a routine audit. The campaign concluded with the actors covering their tracks by deleting temporary files and obfuscating command history, leaving minimal forensic evidence beyond the tagged techniques.",
