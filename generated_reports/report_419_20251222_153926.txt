Background: Crimson Shadow, a suspected state-sponsored group, has been active since early 2023, focusing on financial data exfiltration. This report simulates their tactics based on open-source intelligence and fictional incident data.

Attack Narrative: The campaign began with reconnaissance, where actors gathered employee emails from social media and company websites, though no specific techniques were observed in this phase. Initial access was achieved through a spearphishing email campaign [T1566.002] that impersonated a trusted vendor, containing a malicious link to a compromised website hosting a fake login page. Upon a user clicking the link, the adversary employed a malicious AutoHotkey script [T1059.010] to execute commands remotely on the compromised system while simultaneously downloading additional payloads via SMB [T1071] to blend with legitimate network traffic. For persistence, the malware installed itself as a cron job [T1053.003] on Linux systems, ensuring execution at scheduled intervals. To evade detection, the actors leveraged Process Doppelgänging [T1055.013] using the TxF API to inject malicious code into a legitimate system process, such as svchost.exe, while conducting file and directory discovery [T1083] to map the environment and identify sensitive data. For lateral movement, the adversary dumped password hashes from the compromised host [T1550.002] and used them in pass the hash authentication attacks to access other systems within the network. Exfiltration was conducted using a custom C2 client that split data across multiple ICMP packets with junk data [T1001.001] to avoid network monitoring tools. Logs from the affected systems showed unusual SMB traffic spikes and failed login attempts from unfamiliar IP addresses, but these were initially dismissed as routine noise. The company's incident response team identified the campaign after detecting anomalous cron job entries and process injection alerts, leading to containment within 48 hours.
