Crimson Viper likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify high-value targets in the energy and financial sectors. The attack began with a supply chain compromise [T1195], where the group injected a malicious DLL into the CI/CD pipeline of a widely used software vendor, leading to the distribution of tainted updates. Concurrently, the actors employed drive-by compromises [T1189] by exploiting reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) on government websites to redirect users to phishing webpages, facilitating initial access. Upon compromise, the adversary used PowerShell [T1059.001] to download and execute payloads [T1105] while establishing persistence through Office application startup [T1137] by embedding malicious VBA code in Outlook. To evade detection, malware was dropped into the Windows System32 directory with hidden attributes [T1564.012] and staged local data in temporary directories [T1074.001], including browser and keylogger outputs. The group then modified cloud compute infrastructure [T1578] by deleting virtual machine snapshots to obscure evidence and leveraged compromised credentials to query customer relationship management software [T1213.004], such as Salesforce, for customer details to enhance phishing operations. For command and control (C2), bidirectional communication [T1102.002] was established using social networking sites and cloud platforms, while exfiltration over alternative protocols [T1048], such as DNS tunneling, was used to transfer stolen data, including credit card information. System logs from affected endpoints showed anomalous network traffic to external IPs, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to the stealthy nature of the attack. The targeted organization, 'Global Energy Corp', reported no prior incidents, but internal audits revealed gaps in patch management and cloud security configurations.
