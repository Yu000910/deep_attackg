On 2024-05-15, a financial services organization reported anomalous activities traced back to a spearphishing voice call [T1566.004] where an employee was tricked into opening a malicious attachment that installed a remote access tool (RAT), granting the attacker full system control. Subsequent analysis revealed that the actors had previously compromised software dependencies by injecting malicious code into the deployment script deploy.ps1 [T1195.001] to capture and transmit financial records. Once initial access was established, the adversary employed Windows Command Shell [T1059.003] to execute commands using cmd.exe /c, such as 'dir C:\Users\Finance' and 'net user', while simultaneously scheduling tasks with the At utility [T1053.002] to run a data exfiltration script every Friday via Win32_ScheduledJob. For persistence, the backdoor hijacked the Messenger service registry key in HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services [T1574.011] to maintain access and leveraged temporary elevated cloud access [T1548.005] by using iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator to create short-lived tokens for elevated cloud API access, which allowed them to update Entra ID conditional access policies [T1556.009] to exclude their compromised accounts from security controls. Additionally, the malware dropped a malicious version of wdigest.dll [T1556.002] to extract plaintext credentials from LSASS memory and used AADInternals [T1087.004] to enumerate Azure AD users, facilitating lateral movement. The attacker then employed MailSniper [T1114.002] to search for emails containing financial information in the compromised Exchange server and utilized web protocols [T1071.001] for C2 communications via HTTP. To monetize access, the actors sold access to a network of compromised corporate workstations functioning as HTTP proxies [T1496] and injected a malicious DLL into the banking application [T1565] to modify transaction histories. System logs from the affected environment show routine backup processes at 02:00 UTC daily, with no anomalies detected in those logs, and the organization, 'FinSecure Corp', operates primarily in North America with 500+ employees, though this background is unrelated to the attack chain.
