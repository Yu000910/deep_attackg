Background: FICTIONAL-APT-2024-001 is a simulated threat actor group with suspected ties to fictional nation-state interests, focusing on financial data theft. The campaign was first observed in early 2024, with initial indicators from email security logs at a mid-sized bank, showing anomalous link clicks from internal users. The bank's IT team reported unusual network traffic patterns, including spikes in outbound connections to unknown IP addresses, but no actual data loss occurred as this is a training exercise.

Attack Narrative: The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify high-value targets, such as financial analysts and IT administrators, before launching the attack. In the initial access phase, the adversary sent spearphishing emails [T1566.002] containing malicious links [T1204.001] that directed victims to compromised websites hosting payloads, which were then executed upon user interaction. Once inside the network, the threat actor leveraged container administration commands [T1609] using tools like kubectl to deploy malicious pods and run scripts within Kubernetes environments, while simultaneously modifying the authentication process [T1556] by using Procdump to create memory dumps of the LSASS process for offline credential extraction and dumping securityd memory [T1555.002] to retrieve plaintext credentials from the keychain on macOS systems. To evade detection, the actor encoded command and control (C2) communications [T1132] by gzipping messages to bypass content inspection systems, and then exfiltrated sensitive financial data [T1041] over the same C2 channel to external servers. Additional noise includes system logs showing routine backup failures and unrelated firewall alerts that were not part of the attack chain, as well as background on the targeted bank's recent merger with a smaller institution, which had no impact on the incident response.
