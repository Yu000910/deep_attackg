The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with a fictional educational scenario based on observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the APT group SHADOW SERPENT. This group has been active in targeting organizations in the energy and finance sectors, with initial access often gained through reconnaissance activities. In this simulated incident, SHADOW SERPENT actors likely conducted reconnaissance by performing DNS queries against multiple nameservers to gather information about subdomains [T1596.001] and executed large-scale vulnerability scans to identify vulnerable servers [T1595.002], while also using nslookup commands to resolve the target's domain and identify associated CDN IP ranges [T1596.004]. Upon identifying a vulnerable web server, the actors exploited a known vulnerability to gain initial access, as logged in system logs showing unusual traffic patterns from external IP addresses. The company, a mid-sized energy provider with offices in multiple states, reported no prior incidents but noted increased network latency during this period. Following initial compromise, the actors employed PowerShell scripts to download additional tools, which were used to access Windows Credential Manager to harvest saved web and application credentials from local accounts [T1078.003] and exploit an XPC Service daemon vulnerability to escalate from user to administrative privileges [T1559.003]. They then altered the portable executable of a commonly used administrative tool to execute their code with elevated privileges via thread local storage injection [T1055.005]. During this phase, network monitoring tools detected anomalous process creation events, but no alerts were triggered due to misconfigured thresholds. The actors subsequently used captured credentials to access web portals, where they employed WARPWIRE to capture credentials submitted during the web logon process for layer seven applications such as RDP [T1056.003], and used klist.exe to view Kerberos ticket expiration times and session keys to steal or forge Kerberos tickets [T1558]. They also used the AD Explorer tool to enumerate users on the victim's network by targeting domain accounts [T1087.002]. Internal security logs showed multiple failed login attempts from compromised accounts, which were initially attributed to user error. For lateral movement, the actors exploited tscon.exe by passing a compromised session ID to gain unauthorized RDP access through RDP hijacking [T1563.002] and used Manjusaka to take screenshots of the victim desktop [T1113]. Company employees reported slow performance on affected systems, but IT support dismissed it as routine maintenance issues. Finally, for data exfiltration, the actors leveraged SMB for data exfiltration, disguising malicious transfers as normal file server activity using application layer protocols [T1071] and exploited Bluetooth HID protocol weaknesses to exfiltrate keystroke logs from infected systems over Bluetooth [T1011.001]. The incident was discovered during a routine audit when unusual SMB traffic patterns were flagged, but no data loss was confirmed in this fictional scenario. This report serves as a training tool to highlight the importance of monitoring for these TTPs and implementing robust security measures.
