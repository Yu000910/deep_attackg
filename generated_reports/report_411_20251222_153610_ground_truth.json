    "clean_text": "Storm-1811, a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has been observed targeting financial and technology sectors in a coordinated campaign dubbed 'VoicePhantom'. The actors initiate contact via voice calls, posing as IT support to trick users into downloading and executing malicious scripts. Upon execution, the malware employs COM hijacking to replace legitimate COM objects with malicious ones, ensuring persistence and code execution upon system activation. The adversary then leverages the Lua interpreter to execute system commands for reconnaissance and data collection while using BITSAdmin to create BITS jobs for lateral tool transfer across SMB file servers. Internally, the malware drops a PowerShell script that executes commands to compromise additional domain accounts and utilizes multi-stage channels through scripts like 'host_info.ps1' to collect network adapter settings and user privileges. All command-and-control traffic is encrypted with AES to obscure communications, and the malware writes a PowerShell script named 'malicious.ps1' to the %TEMP% directory to prepare for scheduled data exfiltration. Background noise: The campaign was first detected in Q3 2024, with initial incidents reported at a mid-sized software company, where system logs showed unusual PowerShell activity at 02:00 UTC, coinciding with scheduled maintenance windows. The company's internal firewall recorded multiple failed SMB connection attempts from compromised workstations, but no alerts were triggered due to misconfigured thresholds.",
