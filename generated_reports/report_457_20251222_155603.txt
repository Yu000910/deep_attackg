The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to disseminate information on the fictional threat actor 'ShadowMimic', whose activities are simulated for educational purposes to train cybersecurity defenders. This report outlines a multi-stage attack campaign targeting financial and technology organizations, based on a realistic scenario that incorporates various adversarial techniques without actual harm.

Initial reconnaissance was conducted by the adversary using open-source intelligence (OSINT) methods, including performing a Google search for 'target company network infrastructure diagram' to map the victim's environment [T1593.002] and browsing dark web forums to acquire information about potential targets [T1597]. System logs from the victim's network showed no unusual activity during this phase, as these actions occurred externally. The company, a mid-sized fintech firm, had recently expanded its cloud infrastructure, which may have increased its attack surface.

Upon gaining initial access, the malware executed systeminfo.exe to enumerate firmware characteristics as part of initial reconnaissance [T1592.003], while malicious code was written to create backdoor.exe with keylogging and remote control capabilities [T1587.001]. The adversary then abused partner-level access to deploy administrative tools across the organization's cloud infrastructure [T1199], leveraging this trusted relationship to establish persistence. During execution, KillDisk called the Windows API to retrieve the hard disk handle and shut down the machine [T1106], and Latrodectus used JavaScript files as part of its infection chain during malicious spam email campaigns [T1059.007], demonstrating a blend of native and script-based techniques.

Discovery activities included Peirates enumerating Kubernetes pods in a given namespace [T1613] to identify container resources, and Okrum identifying proxy servers configured and used by the victim, using them to make HTTP requests to its C2 server [T1090.002]. Network traffic logs indicated increased outbound connections to unknown IP addresses, but these were initially overlooked due to routine maintenance activities. Data exfiltration was performed by writing proprietary source code to a USB flash drive [T1052], with physical security logs showing an unauthorized device connection during off-hours. Finally, attackers impersonated a vendor in an email to trick accounting into paying fake invoices [T1657], resulting in financial loss and highlighting the need for enhanced verification procedures. The company's incident response team was activated after detecting anomalous behavior in cloud logs, but the simulation ended before full remediation could be achieved.
