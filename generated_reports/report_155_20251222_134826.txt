The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on fictional APT activity designated as 'Operation Dream Job.' This campaign targets mid-sized technology companies, with initial reconnaissance involving systematic DNS queries [T1596.001] to map infrastructure, followed by spearphishing via Instagram direct messages [T1566.003] that impersonated friends and linked to malicious HTML pages [T1608.005] disguised as software updates. The actors leveraged compromised email accounts [T1586.002] through brute-force attacks and employed tools like Wake-On-Lan and Responder [T1588.002] for network exploitation. A supply chain compromise [T1195] was executed by backdooring a legitimate development tool, while persistence was established by altering registry keys to include a rogue network provider [T1556.008] and using Azure PowerShell [T1059.009] to enumerate virtual machines. Post-exploitation, the adversaries cleared network connection history [T1070.007] to obscure evidence and abused Visual Studio Code's remote SSH extension [T1219.001] for persistent control over developer systems. System logs from target environments showed anomalous DNS requests and failed login attempts, though these were initially dismissed as routine noise. The campaign's objective appears to be intellectual property theft, with no actual data exfiltration observed in this training scenario.
