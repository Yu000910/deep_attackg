On October 15, 2023, a mid-sized regional bank, 'SecureTrust Financial', reported suspicious activity following an employee clicking a link in a spearphishing email that appeared to originate from a trusted vendor, leading to the download of a malicious ZIP file [T1566.002]. System logs from the infected workstation showed unusual PowerShell activity at 14:30 UTC, where the adversary employed PowerShell [T1059.001] to execute a script that downloaded additional payloads from a compromised server while simultaneously using ListPlanting techniques [T1055.015] to hijack a legitimate banking application process for credential theft. The malware then established persistence by dynamically resolving C2 domains through encrypted HTTPS traffic [T1568], leveraging a dead drop resolver on a social media platform to retrieve encrypted commands [T1102.001]. Over the next 48 hours, the malware exfiltrated stolen customer financial data, including account numbers and transaction histories, by posting it to a webhook endpoint using base64 encoding [T1567.004], and concurrently initiated SMS pumping attacks via AWS SNS to send premium-rate messages, generating fraudulent revenue [T1496.003]. Incident responders noted that the bank's firewall logs showed normal outbound traffic to common services like Office 365, but deeper analysis revealed anomalous patterns in DNS queries matching known malicious domains. The bank's IT team has since isolated the affected systems and is conducting a full forensic review, with no customer data confirmed as publicly leaked at this time.
