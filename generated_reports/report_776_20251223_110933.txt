The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on simulated activity by APT-42, a fictional advanced persistent threat group. This campaign targets organizations in the financial and technology sectors, leveraging a combination of open-source intelligence and compromised infrastructure. APT-42 likely conducts reconnaissance by scanning public-facing servers for vulnerabilities [T1595.002] and gathering email addresses [T1589.002] and credentials [T1589.001] from previously infected hosts and spoofed websites. Initial access was achieved through spearphishing emails [T1566] that mimicked legitimate internal communications, leading to the download of a malicious payload. Upon execution, the adversary established persistence by writing a systemd service file to disk [T1053.006] and used PowerShell to extract root CA certificates from the Windows certificate store [T1649] while simultaneously discovering Wi-Fi network configurations [T1016.002] and gathering system information such as computer names [T1082]. The actors then captured desktop screenshots [T1113] and staged harvested browser cookies in /tmp/cache [T1074] before compressing files with gzip [T1560.001] for exfiltration. To evade detection, APT-42 masked their command-and-control communications using a VPN service [T1665]. Logs from the affected systems showed unusual network traffic patterns and failed login attempts, though these were initially overlooked during routine monitoring. The targeted organization, a mid-sized tech firm with offices in multiple regions, reported no actual data loss, but this scenario highlights critical gaps in their security posture.
