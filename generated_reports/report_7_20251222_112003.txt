On October 15, 2023, Crimson Shadow actors initiated a campaign against a fictional organization, 'GlobalEd Corp', an educational technology provider. System logs from their SIEM showed unusual login attempts from an IP address in a non-business region, but these were initially dismissed as false positives. The actors first abused a trusted Office 365 partner account to gain administrative access to GlobalEd's tenant [T1199], leveraging this relationship to bypass standard authentication controls. Subsequently, they delivered a spear-phishing email containing a malicious Word document to a student intern at GlobalEd, who inadvertently opened it, executing embedded macros that downloaded additional payloads [T1204.002]. Once executed, the malware wrote a malicious DLL named 'netapi32.dll' into a user-writable directory to hijack the search order and achieve persistence [T1574.008]. The malware then initiated Responder.exe to poison LLMNR and NBT-NS queries, intercepting and relaying authentication credentials across the network [T1557.001]. For command and control, the backdoor employed libpcap to monitor network traffic patterns and dynamically select hidden ports to evade detection [T1205]. Finally, the actors used a PowerShell script to modify the local user account 'backupsvc' by setting its password to never expire, interfering with security policies and hindering account recovery efforts [T1531]. GlobalEd's incident response team noted increased CPU usage on several endpoints, but initial scans failed to identify the root cause due to the stealthy nature of the traffic signaling.
