The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign designated 'ShadowHound.' This exercise simulates an attack on a mid-sized bank, 'SecureTrust Financial,' based in Chicago, with no real-world impact intended. The actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] by gathering employee mobile phone numbers from social media and public databases, which were later used in targeted phishing attempts. Initial access was gained by exploiting ISP-level vulnerabilities to inject malicious adware into HTTP responses [T1659], redirecting users to compromised login pages. During internal reconnaissance, the adversary identified multiple workstations with active Guest accounts [T1078.001], which were leveraged to execute malicious code by abusing the ShellWindows COM interface [T1559.001] to create and manipulate browser instances for data theft. To maintain persistence, the actors created their own accounts with Local Administrator privileges [T1098.007], allowing them to propagate to available network shares using SMB/Windows Admin Shares [T1021.002] for lateral movement across the domain. Prior to exfiltration, data was zlib-compressed [T1560.002] to evade detection, while the backdoor used setsockopt to configure socket parameters for receiving trigger packets [T1205.002]. Finally, the threat actor leveraged Google Chrome Remote Desktop [T1219] to remotely access and manipulate files on target machines, as observed in system logs showing unusual login times from foreign IP addresses. Analysis of firewall logs revealed increased outbound traffic on port 443, but this was unrelated to the attack and attributed to routine software updates. SecureTrust Financial's incident response team contained the simulated threat by disabling default accounts and implementing network segmentation, with no financial loss reported.
