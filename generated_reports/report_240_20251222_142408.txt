LuminousMoth, a sophisticated APT group, initiated their campaign by purchasing multiple Cloudflare Workers accounts using cryptocurrency to establish anonymous infrastructure [T1583.007]. Concurrently, they created fake social media accounts on WhatsApp to disseminate security update notifications, harvesting user credentials for initial access [T1586.001]. Upon compromising a target, the actors deployed malware signed with a valid digital certificate to evade detection [T1588.004] and exploited cloud APIs to create persistent backdoor access in virtual machines [T1078.004]. For lateral movement, the malware utilized svchost.exe to execute a malicious DLL [T1569] while Mimikatz.exe was employed to extract Kerberos tickets from domain user sessions [T1078.002]. The actors also used memory dumping tools to extract credentials from browser password managers [T1555.005] and identified running application windows on compromised hosts [T1010]. To maintain access, they hijacked established remote desktop connections [T1563] and exfiltrated email messages from local servers using malicious JavaScript payloads [T1114.001]. Prior to exfiltration, stolen data was encrypted with a custom XOR cipher [T1560.003] and transmitted via DNS tunneling [T1568]. The campaign concluded with the botnet generating massive ICMP echo requests from compromised devices to launch network denial-of-service attacks [T1498]. Background logs from the targeted organization, 'CloudSecure Inc.', showed normal system activity in the weeks leading up to the incident, including routine patch updates and user login attempts from expected IP ranges, which were unrelated to the attack.
