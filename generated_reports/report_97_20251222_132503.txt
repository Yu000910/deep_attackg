The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on the activities of the fictional APT group 'ShadowWeaver.' This group has been observed targeting organizations with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Google Cloud integrations. Initial analysis indicates the actors likely conduct reconnaissance by gathering domain properties [T1590.001] and querying DNS records [T1596.001] to map the target's network infrastructure. System logs from the target's DNS servers show increased queries for subdomains like 'mail.corp.example.com' and 'vpn.corp.example.com,' though these logs are not directly linked to the attack. The adversary then used nmap.exe [T1592.001] to scan the network and identify hosts with specific hardware configurations, such as servers running outdated firmware. Background on the targeted company, 'TechGlobal Inc.,' reveals they operate in the financial sector with offices in New York and London, but this information is not part of the attack chain. To establish initial access, the malware exploited an open Wi-Fi network [T1669] at a remote office, allowing the attacker to tunnel malicious traffic by exploiting misconfigured NAT rules in the perimeter firewall [T1599.001]. The threat actor uploaded a custom RAT from https://c2.com/tools [T1608.002], which was signed with code signing certificates obtained from DigiCert, GlobalSign, and COMOOD [T1588.003] to evade detection. Additionally, the attackers injected a malicious DLL into the software supply chain through a compromised third-party component [T1195], affecting several internal applications. For execution and persistence, the adversary employed 'launchctl' [T1569.001] to replace a legitimate service with a malicious one and modified registry keys [T1218.014] to execute encrypted payloads through MMC. In the cloud environment, the compromised application called 'gcloud secrets describe database-passwords' [T1555.006] to retrieve database connection strings from Google Cloud, while the attacker executed 'net group' [T1069] to enumerate domain groups and their members. Carberp malware was used to hook several Windows API functions [T1056.004] to steal credentials, which were then exfiltrated over the Wireguard VPN protocol [T1071] for command and control. Finally, the script posted stolen credentials to https://webhook.site/endpoint [T1567.004] using HTTP POST requests, completing the data theft phase. Logs from the firewall show normal traffic patterns during off-hours, but these are unrelated to the incident.
