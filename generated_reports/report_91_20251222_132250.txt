On 2023-10-15, security analysts at a mid-sized bank detected anomalous network traffic from an external IP address, later traced to a compromised account. The bank's infrastructure, including legacy Windows servers and Linux-based NAS systems, was under routine maintenance at the time, with logs showing normal user activity from 09:00 to 17:00 EST. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by executing nmap with service detection to gather information about installed software on remote hosts [T1592.002], then used a compromised account to access the organization's VPN infrastructure [T1078] while simultaneously adding a scheduled task to establish persistence [T1053.005]. After gaining access, the adversary searched for SSH configuration files in default locations to collect authentication credentials [T1555] and employed 'findstr /s password \\nas\shared\*.config' to locate configuration files containing credentials across network shares [T1039], aggregating collected credentials in text files before exfiltrating [T1074.001]. For efficient data exfiltration, sensitive files were compressed into RAR format using the rarfile module [T1560.002] and communicated over DNS through queries to the server for constructed domain names with embedded information [T1071.004]. System logs from the affected NAS indicated increased read operations during off-hours, but no alerts were triggered due to misconfigured monitoring rules.
