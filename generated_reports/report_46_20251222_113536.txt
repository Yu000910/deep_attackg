The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams about a fictional campaign attributed to the threat actor 'Shadow Serpent'. This group has been observed targeting financial institutions in a multi-stage attack designed to exfiltrate sensitive data and cause operational disruption. The campaign begins with reconnaissance, where actors likely conduct initial reconnaissance by scanning public-facing servers to gather information on client configurations [T1592.004] and actively probing for vulnerabilities [T1595.002]. In one instance, network logs showed increased traffic on port 3306, though this was unrelated to the attack. Following reconnaissance, the actors compromised the software supply chain by distributing a modified JavaScript library through a cracked software download site [T1195] and embedding a backdoor in the source code before distribution [T1195.002]. The company, FinSecure Corp, reported unusual activity in their development environment, but initial investigations were inconclusive. For initial access, the actors deployed custom malware [T1587.001] that was routed through a network device to evade detection [T1584.008], with command and control traffic observed at http://c2.com/payload. Execution involved leveraging container administration commands [T1609] to run malicious scripts within an Ubuntu container, as seen in a simulated incident where a container entry point executed shell scripts. Persistence was achieved by loading a malicious DLL via LSA authentication packages [T1547.002], ensuring the backdoor remained active across system reboots. System logs indicated multiple failed login attempts, though these were unrelated. For credential access, the actors employed techniques to disable crypto hardware [T1600.002] to recover encrypted data and used tools like secretsdump.py to extract NTLM hashes from the domain controller [T1003.003], while also conducting network sniffing [T1040] to harvest unencrypted Telnet credentials from network communications. Lateral movement included using remote access hardware [T1219.003] such as PiKVM to maintain control over compromised systems through hardware-based methods. The company's background includes a recent merger, but this did not impact the attack. Exfiltration was not a primary focus in this scenario, but actors demonstrated capabilities for data theft. Impact actions involved disk content wipes [T1561.001] by filling storage volumes with pseudorandom bytes to render files unrecoverable and financial theft [T1657] through compromising an executive's email account to send fraudulent payment instructions. Defensive teams should monitor for these indicators and apply patches promptly.
