On March 15, 2024, SHADOW CLOUD initiated a campaign against a fictional financial services company, 'SecureFin Corp', which utilizes AWS cloud services and maintains legacy on-premises Microsoft Exchange servers. The company's security team observed anomalous network traffic from IP addresses associated with Cloudflare Workers, indicating the use of serverless infrastructure for command and control [T1583.007]. Initial access was achieved through a drive-by compromise, where actors created a malicious webpage mimicking SecureFin's employee portal to deliver a fake anti-virus installer [T1189], and concurrently exploited a known vulnerability (CVE-2024-1234) in a public-facing web application to gain unauthorized access to an edge device [T1190]. Once inside, the actors employed a malicious Excel document delivered via phishing to trick users into executing macros, which downloaded additional payloads [T1204.002] while modifying registry keys to reduce Security event logging levels and block indicators of compromise [T1562.006]. Lateral movement involved using Remote Desktop Protocol to connect to internal servers [T1021.001], where tools like OutSteel were deployed to collect sensitive data from local systems [T1005] and execute Responder commands for LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning to harvest credentials and relay SMB traffic [T1557.001]. The actors further conducted network reconnaissance by executing SNMP queries to dump configuration data from network devices [T1602.002] and injected malicious payloads into DNS queries to establish persistent backdoor access [T1659]. To obscure their activities, SHADOW CLOUD utilized SSH tunneling to encapsulate traffic within legitimate protocols [T1572] and programmatically created numerous AWS SNS topics and subscriptions, hijacking cloud services to degrade performance and evade detection [T1496.004]. System logs from SecureFin's SIEM showed increased CPU usage on Exchange servers and anomalous DNS requests, though some entries were suppressed due to the registry modifications. The company's background includes a recent migration to hybrid cloud, which may have introduced misconfigurations exploited in this attack.
