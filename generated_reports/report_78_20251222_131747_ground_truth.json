    "clean_text": "Background: 'CloudSnare' is assessed to operate with financial motives, leveraging a multi-stage attack chain against global banks. Initial reconnaissance involved monitoring public employee profiles on LinkedIn, though no specific techniques were identified in this phase. The attack began with actors deploying a fake Office 365 login page on a compromised subdomain to harvest user credentials, while simultaneously altering DNS MX records to intercept and monitor email traffic from the target organization. Following credential theft, the actors exploited a trusted software vendor by replacing a legitimate binary in a software update with a trojanized version that delivered additional payloads. Once inside the network, the adversary employed AWS Lambda to upload and execute a malicious Python script for serverless code execution, while renaming 'rundll32.exe' to 'dllhost32.exe' to evade detection by masquerading as a legitimate utility. To move laterally, the attacker used Pass-the-Hash techniques to authenticate to remote systems without plaintext passwords, and leveraged Cobalt Strike with domain fronting by manipulating HTTP Host Headers to conceal command and control traffic. Data exfiltration was orchestrated via PowerShell scripts scheduled to transfer stolen files at regular intervals, and the campaign concluded with the exploitation of exposed Docker APIs to deploy cryptocurrency mining containers, hijacking cloud compute resources for financial gain. Logs from affected systems showed increased CPU usage and network anomalies, but these were unrelated to the tagged techniques. The advisory recommends implementing multi-factor authentication, monitoring for unusual DNS changes, and securing cloud APIs to mitigate similar threats.",
