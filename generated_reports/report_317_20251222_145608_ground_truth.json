    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training insights into a fictional APT campaign. CRIMSON SHADOW actors likely conduct reconnaissance to identify vulnerable targets. They exploited known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-1000486 in a public-facing application to gain initial access, while simultaneously leveraging a virtual private server on AWS EC2 with cryptocurrency payments to establish untraceable command and control channels. Upon compromise, the actors employed PowerShell to download and execute a custom remote administration tool from https://c2.com/tools, which they had previously obtained by purchasing a cryptojacking script from a darknet vendor. System logs from the victim environment show routine maintenance activities, including database updates and user authentication events, which are unrelated to the attack. For defense evasion, the actors executed PowerShell.exe to disable Windows Defender real-time protection and modified pam_unix.so to bypass password authentication for specific accounts. They then deployed a malicious container using 'docker create' to bypass host-based controls and established persistence through a scheduled task with schtasks /create /sc, DLL side-loading to execute payloads, and creation of a local account on victim machines. Additional persistence was achieved by creating a shortcut in the startup folder pointing to msdtc.exe and adding a hidden process to login items via AppleScript. The malware used custom HTTP Accept headers to impersonate legitimate protocols for C2 communication. Background information on the targeted organization includes its use of legacy SAP systems and recent cloud migration efforts, which are not directly linked to the incident. Blue teams should monitor for these behaviors and enhance detection capabilities.",

The campaign leverages cloud infrastructure, containerization, and multiple persistence mechanisms to deploy cryptojacking malware and maintain long-term access.
