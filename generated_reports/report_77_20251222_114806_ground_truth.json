    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign designated 'SilentReaper'. This campaign targets corporate environments through a multi-stage attack chain. Initial reconnaissance involved actors querying Facebook profiles of executives to gather information about physical office locations, which was used to tailor spear-phishing emails. Following initial access via a compromised software update, the adversary employed PowerShell to inject malicious code into update.ps1, stealing browser cookies and session data while simultaneously monitoring Windows message loop events to log user keyboard input. System logs from infected hosts show increased CPU usage during these activities, though no alerts were triggered initially. To evade detection, the malware modified registry keys to disable Windows Firewall across all network profiles and used a Revenge RAT plugin for screen capture. Internal network enumeration was conducted using a SharePoint tool known as spwebmember, which dumped sensitive documents from corporate portals. For lateral movement, the actors leveraged Inveigh to perform LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning and SMB relay attacks, capturing credentials from multiple departments. Command and control was established via a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) that derived URLs from a word list, with exfiltration occurring over unencrypted FTP protocols to external servers. Finally, the malware initiated a system shutdown to cover tracks after data theft, mimicking routine maintenance reboots. Network traffic analysis revealed anomalous FTP connections during off-hours, but no immediate action was taken due to misconfigured alerts.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by the fictional threat actor group 'SilentReaper' targeting multinational corporations to exfiltrate sensitive data and disrupt operations. The campaign leverages social media reconnaissance, supply chain compromise, and evasion techniques, culminating in data theft and system disruption. Blue teams should review logs for unusual PowerShell activity, registry modifications, and network anomalies.",
