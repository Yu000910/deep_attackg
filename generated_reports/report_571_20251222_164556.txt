On March 15, 2024, multiple financial institutions reported suspicious activity leading to data breaches. Investigation revealed a coordinated attack by the fictional APT group 'ShadowPhish', which likely began with reconnaissance through phishing emails containing fake password reset requests to harvest credentials [T1598]. The actors then compromised three internal websites using a Flash exploit to perform watering hole attacks, redirecting employees to malicious sites [T1189]. Upon infection, the adversary employed Unix shell scripts [T1059.004] to download and install the main payload while simultaneously modifying domain policies to grant their account local administrator rights across all computers [T1484]. For persistence, the malware called AddMonitor to register a malicious port monitor DLL [T1547.010], and the malicious script utilized bash commands to save collected browser cookies to an encrypted container for staging [T1074]. Data exfiltration was automated using batch scripts [T1020] and mimicked legitimate services with customized HTTP URL paths and headers to hide traffic [T1001.003], with exfiltrated data stored in a shared Dropbox folder accessible only through burner accounts [T1585.003]. System logs from the affected servers showed normal traffic patterns prior to the attack, and the company background includes a merger with a smaller regional bank last year, which may have introduced vulnerabilities. No actual financial losses occurred in this training scenario.
