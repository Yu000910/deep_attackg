In this simulated scenario, Crimson Hydra, a fictional APT group, targeted a mid-sized technology firm, 'TechNova Solutions', which operates a hybrid environment with on-premises VMware infrastructure and cloud-based Kubernetes clusters. The firm's background includes developing IoT devices and using third-party IT management services. Initial access was achieved by exploiting a trusted relationship with a third-party service provider [T1199], where the adversary used delegated administrator permissions to gain administrative access to TechNova's Microsoft Azure tenant. Once inside, the actors conducted extensive internal reconnaissance by downloading tools like Advanced Port Scanner and Lansweeper to gather victim network information [T1590], including scanning for VMware VCenter to access host configuration and cluster data. System logs from TechNova's SIEM showed unusual login attempts from the service provider's IP range, but these were initially dismissed as routine maintenance. The actors then pivoted to containerized environments, using Docker administration commands such as 'docker exec -it container_name /bin/bash' to gain interactive shell access to running containers [T1609], allowing them to execute malicious scripts and deploy backdoors. Subsequently, they targeted domain controllers, employing Mimikatz to recover plaintext passwords from LSASS memory dumps, exploiting cached domain credentials [T1003.005]. Network traffic analysis revealed anomalous connections from compromised containers to internal servers, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured firewall rules. Finally, to maintain persistence and covert access, the actors abused existing PiKVM installations within the network, establishing remote access hardware channels [T1219.003] to control physical systems without triggering traditional network-based detections. Throughout the campaign, Crimson Hydra combined techniques, such as using trusted relationships [T1199] to facilitate internal reconnaissance [T1590] and container administration [T1609] while simultaneously extracting credentials [T1003.005] and leveraging remote hardware [T1219.003] for stealthy operations.
