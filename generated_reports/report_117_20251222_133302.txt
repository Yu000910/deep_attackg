The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams of a fictional APT campaign, APT-F47, observed targeting energy and financial sectors. This report is for training purposes only, based on a simulated scenario. APT-F47 likely conducted reconnaissance by querying public certificate databases to identify digital certificates associated with target email servers [T1596.003]. Initial access was achieved through spearphishing voice attacks, where malicious documents were delivered via phone calls, and by exploiting open Wi-Fi networks to gain unauthorized entry into target devices [T1566.004, T1669]. Upon execution, the adversary employed systemctl to enable a persistence daemon, ensuring continued access across system reboots, while using at.exe to schedule commands for deleting log files at midnight [T1569.003, T1053.002]. Forced authentication was leveraged through malicious documents that executed PowerShell scripts to extract LSASS memory for credential harvesting [T1187]. Command and control communications were established using FTP protocols for data exfiltration, and traffic duplication techniques were applied by modifying system images to create covert channels for mirroring network traffic [T1071.002, T1020.001]. Data manipulation was performed by injecting malicious DLLs into web browsers to hijack user sessions and alter session data [T1565]. Background noise: The target organization, 'Global Energy Solutions Inc.', reported unusual network activity on its internal servers, with logs showing failed login attempts from unknown IP addresses. Company policies were recently updated to enforce multi-factor authentication, but legacy systems remained vulnerable. System administrators noted increased CPU usage on email servers, though initial scans detected no malware. The campaign's timeline spanned two weeks, with initial alerts triggered by anomalous outbound traffic patterns. Blue teams should monitor for these techniques and implement network segmentation and endpoint detection.
