    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams about the fictional APT group 'ShadowGale'. This group has been observed conducting targeted attacks against organizations in the financial and technology sectors over the past six months. Initial analysis suggests the actors likely conduct reconnaissance by gathering victim organization information, including employee hierarchies and press releases, and have used large language models (LLMs) to identify potential targets of interest. Following this, they developed a custom DLL side-loading exploit to execute malicious code under the guise of legitimate software, such as a compromised accounting tool. For initial access, the adversaries exploited public-facing applications, leveraging vulnerabilities like CVE-2021-26855 against a vulnerable Microsoft Exchange Server to gain entry into the victim network. Once inside, they employed user execution techniques, distributing a fake CAPTCHA that instructed victims to open the Windows Run window and paste Base64-encoded PowerShell commands, which were then executed to download additional payloads. The malware subsequently performed software discovery to enumerate installed programs on the compromised systems. To expand their foothold, the actors used stolen credentials to invoke 'Connect-AzAccount' and gain access to the victim's Azure subscription for lateral movement, while also leveraging EternalBlue to exploit SMB and compromise remote hosts within the network. For command and control (C2), they utilized dynamic DNS providers to obscure their infrastructure. Finally, the malware exfiltrated data by downloading folders' contents and uploading the results to a Dropbox drive. During the investigation, system logs from the victim's firewall showed routine traffic spikes unrelated to the attack, and the company's background revealed recent mergers that may have increased their attack surface. No evidence of data encryption or ransomware was found in this scenario.",
