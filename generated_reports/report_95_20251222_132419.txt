On 2023-10-15, security analysts at 'Global Trust Bank' detected anomalous network traffic originating from external IP addresses, which initiated a ping sweep across the bank's public IP range to map active hosts [T1595.001]. Concurrently, the actors scraped the bank's public-facing websites, querying the careers page to identify periods of increased hiring activity, indicative of potential security lapses during organizational expansion [T1591.003], and extracting employee names from the 'About Us' section to facilitate social engineering attacks [T1589.003]. System logs from the web server showed unusual HTTP POST requests at 14:30 UTC, leading to the deployment of a web shell on an internet-facing server, establishing persistent access for command-and-control (C2) operations [T1650]. The actors then leveraged this access to exploit external remote services, such as VPN endpoints, using compromised credentials to move laterally into internal network segments [T1133]. Once inside, they employed inter-process communication mechanisms, using named pipes to transfer data between kernel and user mode components of their malware, enabling stealthy execution [T1559]. To evade detection, the malware utilized Ptrace system calls to allocate memory in legitimate processes like svchost.exe, injecting shellcode while checking for debuggers with IsDebuggerPresent calls to avoid analysis [T1055.008, T1622]. The actors also created self-signed digital certificates to encrypt C2 traffic over HTTPS, masking their communications [T1587.003], and modified DNS settings on compromised workstations to redirect banking portal queries to phishing servers, capturing login credentials [T1584.002]. For data collection, they ran Outlook.exe with command-line parameters to extract email attachments from executive mailboxes [T1114] and used git archive commands to compress and backup code repositories containing proprietary algorithms [T1213.003]. Exfiltration was conducted through multiple channels: stolen credentials were sent via XMPP chat messages using publish/subscribe protocols [T1071.005], while larger datasets, such as customer information, were posted to external web servers via HTTP POST commands over unencrypted connections [T1048.003], and other sensitive logs were transmitted back to C2 servers over encrypted channels [T1041]. Prior to exfiltration, the actors terminated critical services, including antivirus and logging services, using the Service Control Manager API to hinder incident response efforts [T1489]. Background noise includes routine firewall logs showing blocked port scans from unrelated IPs and internal system updates that occurred during the same timeframe, which are not indicative of malicious activity.
