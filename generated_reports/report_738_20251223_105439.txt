On 2023-10-15, a security team at 'Global Utilities Inc.' detected anomalous network activity. The company, a mid-sized energy provider with operations in North America and Europe, reported unusual spikes in traffic from unknown IP addresses. Initial analysis of firewall logs showed multiple connection attempts to internal servers on port 443, but no immediate breaches were confirmed. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by scanning IP blocks [T1595.001] using hping3 to craft TCP packets for host discovery, while also running nmap.exe with the -O flag to perform operating system detection on target hosts [T1592.001]. This dual approach allowed them to map the network topology and identify vulnerable systems. Subsequently, the attacker dropped a USB Rubber Ducky in the company parking lot, which an unsuspecting employee found and plugged into their workstation [T1200], leading to the execution of a malicious payload. The malware then leveraged a virtual private server from a cloud service provider for command and control [T1584.003], employing PowerShell to actively download additional tools [T1059.001] while simultaneously modifying registry keys [T1112] to maintain persistence. On compromised Linux hosts, the adversary used the Hypervisor CLI with 'esxcli storage filesystem list' to gather information about available datastores and storage systems [T1059.012] and achieved persistent access by adding a reverse shell command to /etc/profile [T1546.004]. For credential theft, the trojan hooked keyboard interrupt handlers to log keystrokes during authentication [T1056.004], and attackers exfiltrated krb5cc_1001 from the compromised host to impersonate the domain user [T1558.005]. Additionally, the malware collected a list of installed antivirus software from the victim's system [T1518.001] and listed local services [T1007] to identify security controls and potential exploitation points. The adversary also queried Microsoft Teams to gather employee contact information and organizational structure [T1213.005], and compromised credentials were transmitted through XMPP private messages disguised as legitimate chat traffic [T1071.005]. System logs from affected hosts showed increased CPU usage during these activities, but no alerts were triggered by the existing antivirus software, which was later found to be outdated. The campaign highlights the need for enhanced monitoring of external scans and USB device policies.
