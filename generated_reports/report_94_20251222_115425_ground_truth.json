    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams about a fictional APT campaign for training purposes. APT-Zeta, a state-sponsored actor, has been observed targeting technology firms by compromising hardware supply chains to distribute modified Teensy USB devices that infect systems upon connection. Once initial access is gained, the actors load shared malicious DLL modules to execute additional plugins for reconnaissance and persistence. System logs from affected organizations show anomalous USB activity, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured monitoring tools. The malware then exploits local vulnerabilities to escalate privileges to administrative levels, enabling deeper system access. Concurrently, the actors query cloud service dashboards to discover databases with weak authentication, while using internet connection discovery to identify network pathways and exfiltration routes. Log enumeration tools are employed to parse and extract sensitive information from system logs, such as user credentials and configuration details. To maintain covert access, the malware installs a malicious Visual Studio Code extension that establishes IDE tunneling for remote command execution. As part of the attack lifecycle, the actors use stolen credentials to execute lifecycle-triggered deletion commands, automatically emptying cloud storage buckets to destroy data. Finally, a destructive payload overwrites critical boot sector files with random binary data, rendering systems inoperable and causing significant operational disruption. Background checks on the USB supplier revealed no prior security incidents, highlighting the stealth of this supply chain attack.",
