    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide insights into a fictional campaign attributed to the threat actor CobaltShade, which targets financial organizations globally. This report is based on simulated activities for educational use by blue teams.\n\nCobaltShade initiates its campaign by conducting extensive reconnaissance to gather victim organization information, such as employee roles and departmental structures from public sources like LinkedIn and company websites. Concurrently, the actors engage in phishing for information by sending deceptive emails to employees, masquerading as IT support to elicit network details and credentials. Once initial data is collected, the adversary performs scanning of IP blocks using custom Python scripts to ping multiple addresses and identify active network nodes for further targeting.\n\nUpon gaining access, CobaltShade leverages stolen domain accounts to authenticate into the network, often using credentials obtained from earlier phishing efforts. The actors then employ Python to execute malicious scripts that download additional payloads and establish persistence, while simultaneously deploying malicious browser extensions through compromised user profiles to steal financial data and session cookies. To maintain command and control (C2) resilience, the backdoor utilizes fast flux DNS by registering multiple DNS A records with short TTL values, enabling dynamic communication with C2 servers and evading detection.\n\nSystem logs from affected networks show increased DNS query volumes and unusual PowerShell activity, though some entries are benign or unrelated to the attack. The targeted organization, a mid-sized bank with operations in North America and Europe, reported no actual financial loss in this simulated scenario, but the campaign highlights the need for robust email filtering and endpoint monitoring. Analysis of network traffic revealed sporadic ping requests to non-routable IP addresses, which may be noise from legacy systems or misconfigured devices.",
