    "clean_text": "On October 15, 2023, a critical infrastructure organization reported anomalous network traffic and performance degradation in their server environment. Background investigation revealed that the organization had recently updated software dependencies, including a popular open-source networking tool. Initial logs from the server room indicated intermittent packet loss and unusual SSL/TLS handshake patterns, with system administrators noting increased CPU usage on core application servers. The organization, a mid-sized energy provider in the Midwest, operates a hybrid cloud infrastructure with legacy on-premises systems.\n\nThe attack began with a supply chain compromise, where a trojanized version of the open-source package was distributed through the official repository, allowing the adversary to gain initial access. Concurrently, hardware additions were discovered, as network administrators identified a passive tap on the server room's Ethernet line, facilitating data exfiltration. Once inside, the actors exploited an XPC service daemon's weak authentication to gain elevated system access, then employed obfuscated Visual Basic macros to execute malicious payloads while embedding junk data in Base64 strings for additional obfuscation. The payload included a keylogging module to capture sensitive credentials, and malicious scripts were used to initiate repeated SSL/TLS renegotiations, causing service exhaustion floods that degraded server availability. Post-incident analysis showed no evidence of lateral movement beyond the initial compromised systems, but logs indicated attempts to modify firewall rules, which were blocked by existing security controls.",
