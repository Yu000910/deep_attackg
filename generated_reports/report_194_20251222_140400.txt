The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training insights into a fictional APT campaign. Crimson Serpent likely conducts reconnaissance by searching open websites and domains [T1593], such as Crunchbase, to gather funding and investor details of victim companies. Initial access was achieved through a compromised web server [T1584.004], which the actors used as a command-and-control (C2) node after querying a private vulnerability database [T1588.006] to exploit unpatched flaws in web server software. The malware then executed a content injection attack [T1659] by exploiting a compromised ISP channel to redirect user traffic through a malicious proxy, leading to a malicious copy and paste operation [T1204.004] where a fraudulent 'Java Runtime Update Needed' notification on a compromised website downloaded and executed malware when users clicked 'Install.' For persistence, the adversary employed HTML smuggling [T1027.006] by writing malicious.html with embedded VBScript to bypass filters and relocated malware [T1070.010] by copying malware.exe to the Windows system32 directory. To evade detection, they performed a downgrade attack [T1562.010] by executing PowerShell.exe using version 2 compatibility to bypass modern security features, while also modifying pluggable authentication modules [T1556.003] by patching pam_unix.so to accept a master password that would authenticate any user and configuring a network provider DLL [T1556.008] by writing malicious.dll to the system to capture passwords. Discovery activities included password policy discovery [T1201] using net.exe in a script with net accounts /domain to find the domain password policy, peripheral device discovery [T1120] via a Bluetooth device harvester using Windows Bluetooth APIs to identify connected Bluetooth devices, and system network connections discovery [T1049] by testing localhost network availability and other connection capabilities using command scripts. Exfiltration was facilitated through communication via removable media [T1092] using a tool that captures information from air-gapped computers via an infected USB and transfers it to network-connected computers when inserted, with C2 communications embedded in DNS requests and replies [T1071.004] using a custom implementation of DNS tunneling. System logs from the victim's environment showed routine network traffic spikes unrelated to the attack, and background information indicates the targeted company was a mid-sized financial firm with outdated patch management processes.
