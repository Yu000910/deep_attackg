On March 15, 2024, VoltGrid Solutions reported anomalous network traffic and performance degradation in their data center. Investigation revealed a passive Ethernet tap installed in the server room, indicating physical access by an adversary [T1200]. Concurrently, multiple employees accessed a compromised industry news website, which served malicious JavaScript that downloaded a payload onto their systems [T1189]. The payload, a DLL file, was executed by abusing the svchost.exe process to run as a system service, enabling persistence and network propagation [T1569]. Logs from the MS-SQL server showed unauthorized use of the sp_addlinkedsrvlogin command to link a newly created administrative account to other servers, facilitating lateral movement [T1098]. The adversary then employed grep -E to search the /proc filesystem for process memory containing password patterns, extracting credentials from running applications [T1003.007]. Network analysis identified Smart Install queries sent to Cisco switches, resulting in the extraction of configuration files that revealed network topology and access controls [T1602.002]. A monitoring script was discovered copying clipboard contents every 30 seconds, capturing sensitive data such as passwords and API keys [T1115]. The malware established a backdoor using TeamViewer, providing interactive remote access to compromised workstations [T1219.002]. Exfiltrated data, including email archives and network diagrams, was uploaded to a remote server via anonymous FTP, bypassing standard security protocols [T1048]. Finally, the attackers leveraged unsecured cloud instance metadata APIs to deploy cryptocurrency mining software, hijacking computational resources and causing significant performance issues [T1496.001]. Background checks revealed no prior physical security breaches at VoltGrid, and system logs indicated normal user activity prior to the incident, with no immediate correlation to the hardware addition.
