APT-EDU-01 initiated the campaign by conducting spear-phishing voice calls [T1566.004] to employees, directing them to download a remote access trojan disguised as a document viewer from a compromised website. Upon execution, the malware used schtasks.exe to schedule recurring tasks [T1053] for credential harvesting and modified registry keys to enable malicious screensaver execution after idle periods [T1546.002], while simultaneously clearing Windows Event Log entries to obscure initial compromise traces [T1546]. The actors then employed Rubeus to forge silver tickets [T1558.002] for lateral movement and parsed Slack Workflow JSON files to harvest unsecured OAuth tokens from chat messages [T1552.008]. Additionally, a JavaScript keylogger was deployed on the employee self-service portal to capture login credentials [T1056.003], and the malware scanned GitHub commit histories for exposed .env files in code repositories [T1213.003] to collect sensitive environment variables. To facilitate data exfiltration, the malware captured and replaced Bitcoin wallet data in the clipboard [T1115] and used HTTPS for encrypted command and control [T1573.002] with bidirectional communication via OneDrive [T1102.002]. System logs from the compromised host, such as 'Event ID 4688: A new process has been created' and network traffic to external IPs like 192.0.2.1, were observed but are unrelated to the tagged techniques. The company, a mid-sized financial services firm with 500 employees, reported unusual network slowdowns and unauthorized access attempts on internal portals, though these details serve as background noise for training purposes.
