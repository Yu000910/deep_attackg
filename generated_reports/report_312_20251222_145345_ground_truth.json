    "clean_text": "On October 15, 2024, security teams at a fictional financial institution, 'SecureBank Corp.', detected anomalous activity on their customer portal server. SecureBank Corp., founded in 1998, operates primarily in North America with over 5,000 employees and a focus on digital banking services. Initial logs showed unusual SQL queries at 03:00 UTC, but no immediate alerts were triggered by the SIEM system.\n\nThe actors likely conducted reconnaissance to identify vulnerabilities in SecureBank's web applications. They then exploited a SQL injection flaw in the public-facing customer portal, gaining unauthorized access to the backend database. Following this, they sent spearphishing emails to IT administrators, containing a malicious link that, when clicked, redirected to a compromised website hosting a malicious Docker image designed to hide a cryptocurrency miner.\n\nUpon execution, the malware used MSBuild.exe to compile and run malicious code while simultaneously establishing persistence by writing a VBScript to the Windows Startup folder. The adversary then dumped both /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files from Linux servers to crack password hashes offline, while employing Tor exit nodes to anonymize their network traffic and evade detection. Additionally, they deployed an automated bot to flood SecureBank's security team inbox with thousands of spam emails, causing distraction and delaying response efforts. System logs from the affected server indicated increased CPU usage and network connections to unknown IP addresses, but these were initially overlooked due to the email bombing campaign.",
