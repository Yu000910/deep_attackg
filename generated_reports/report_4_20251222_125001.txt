APT-42 likely conducts reconnaissance through social engineering, compromising a legitimate Instagram account to send direct messages with links to fake login pages [T1566.003], which led to credential harvesting. Upon successful phishing, the adversary executed malicious code by employing dlopen to load a shared object containing backdoor functionality [T1129] while simultaneously using compromised credentials to modify Okta conditional access settings, bypassing session timeouts [T1556.009]. System logs from the target environment show routine backup processes running at 02:00 UTC daily, unrelated to the attack. Following execution, the threat actor performed discovery activities, querying the Docker API to inspect container network configurations [T1613] and scanning for removable disks attached to systems [T1120]. The organization, a mid-sized tech firm with offices in three countries, reported no prior incidents in Q1. Data collection involved querying the AWS CloudWatch API to gather performance metrics and logs from cloud instances [T1530], and the malware manipulated the Microsoft Messaging API to forward all calendar invitations and meeting requests to a malicious actor [T1114.003]. Additionally, NETWIRE was deployed to perform keylogging [T1056.001], capturing sensitive input. For persistence and command and control, TeamViewer was misused to maintain interactive remote access [T1219.002], and attackers leveraged NTP servers with monlist enabled to reflect and amplify traffic toward the organization's IP [T1498.002], causing network disruption. Internal firewall logs indicated blocked connections from unknown IP ranges during this period.
