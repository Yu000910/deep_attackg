The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional APT campaign. ShadowVeil actors likely initiated reconnaissance by querying nameservers to map the target's DNS hierarchy [T1596.001] and using nmap with service detection to gather information about installed software [T1592.002]. Concurrently, they modified social media profiles to enhance persona legitimacy [T1585.001] and queried commercial vulnerability databases for exploitable weaknesses [T1588.006]. In the initial access phase, the actors exploited compromised Azure Managed Identities to persistently access cloud databases [T1078.004]. Upon execution, the malware leveraged Dynamic Data Exchange auto-linking to download and execute payloads from remote servers [T1559.002] while intercepting SMS-based one-time passwords and using cloned websites to capture MFA tokens [T1111]. For persistence and privilege escalation, the actors employed WMIC to query useraccount details for administrative privileges [T1069], performed pass the hash attacks [T1550.002], and used stolen authentication tokens to query administrative REST APIs [T1550.001]. System logs from the affected environment showed routine backup activities, but no anomalies were flagged initially. The malware then initiated continuous image capture via the system's camera hardware [T1125] and established covert command and control channels using SSH tunnels to bypass firewall restrictions [T1071]. For exfiltration, the actors used a customized PlugX variant to transfer documents from air-gapped networks over USB [T1052.001]. The target organization, a mid-sized fintech company, reported no financial losses, but the incident highlighted gaps in cloud security monitoring.
