The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training insights into a fictional APT campaign, 'Operation Spalax', attributed to the threat actor Crimson Viper. This campaign targets financial organizations globally, with observed activity from January to March 2024. Crimson Viper likely operates from Eastern Europe, focusing on ransomware deployment and data theft for financial gain. Initial analysis indicates the group uses a combination of open-source intelligence (OSINT) and technical exploitation.

In the reconnaissance phase, the actors conducted extensive searches using Shodan to identify exposed Redis instances with default configurations [T1596.005] while simultaneously querying news websites for articles on recent corporate acquisitions to gather targeting intelligence [T1593]. Upon initial access, the malware deployed queried User-Agent headers to collect detailed victim host information, including browser versions and operating systems [T1592], and the adversary established a professional-looking LinkedIn profile to infiltrate corporate networks [T1585]. For command and control (C2) infrastructure, Crimson Viper registered hundreds of domains using services like Duck DNS and DNS Exit [T1583.001] and searched exploit databases for weaponized vulnerabilities matching the target's software stack [T1588.006].

During execution, the malware exploited a compromised ISP channel to redirect user traffic through a malicious proxy [T1659] and initiated 'docker create' commands to deploy a containerized persistence mechanism that evades traditional antivirus scanning [T1610]. To maintain persistence and evade detection, the threat actor created a fake 'mscoree.dll' in the application's local folder to hijack execution via path interception [T1574.008] and digitally signed malware and utilities to bypass security checks [T1553.002]. For lateral movement, wscript.exe was employed to execute commands while circumventing PowerShell restrictions [T1216.002], and SILENTTRINITY used `System` namespace methods to execute lateral movement via Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) [T1021.003]. SDBbot utilized port forwarding to establish a proxy between the target host and C2 servers [T1090]. In the impact phase, the attacker modified the organization's homepage to display fake cryptocurrency donation requests as part of an external defacement [T1491.002].

Irrelevant system logs from the simulated environment include routine database queries at 2024-03-15 14:30:00 UTC and firewall alerts for blocked IPs that were unrelated to the campaign. The targeted company, 'Global Finance Corp', is a fictional multinational with headquarters in New York and operations in Asia, but these details have no bearing on the attack techniques. Blue teams should note that this advisory is for educational purposes only, and any resemblance to real incidents is coincidental.
