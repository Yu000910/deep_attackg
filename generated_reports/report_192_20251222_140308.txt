On October 15, 2023, a critical infrastructure organization reported anomalous activity in its air-gapped production network, leading to an investigation by the FBI, CISA, and NSA. The organization, a fictional energy provider with operations across North America, maintains segmented networks for industrial control systems (ICS). Initial logs from a workstation in the ICS segment showed unexpected process executions originating from a USB drive inserted by an employee during a routine maintenance check. The adversary likely conducted reconnaissance [T1589] to identify physical access points and employee routines, though no specific indicators were tagged in this phase.

The attack began with the adversary planting a Trojan horse disguised as 'documents.exe' on a USB drive, which was used to replicate malware into the air-gapped network when an employee inadvertently inserted it [T1091]. Once executed, the malware employed the Windows Command Shell [T1059.003] to run commands that disabled local security controls and initiated data exfiltration. Concurrently, the adversary deployed a passive network tap on an internal switch within the compromised segment [T1200], capturing unencrypted credentials from network communications such as SNMP and HTTP traffic, which were later used to escalate privileges.

To expand the attack, the adversary leveraged AWS Systems Manager [T1072] to run commands across all connected cloud instances, disabling security groups and logging mechanisms while using Azure CLI commands [T1098.001] to create a new custom role with extensive permissions in the organization's Azure tenant, ensuring persistence in the cloud environment. Command and control (C2) communications were established using DNS queries [T1071.004] to blend with legitimate traffic, with malware beaconing to domains like 'update.securehost[.]net' at regular intervals.

In the final stages, the adversary executed destructive actions to hinder forensic analysis. On compromised systems, the malware used the 'cipher /w' command [T1561] to securely wipe free disk space, preventing data recovery, while simultaneously launching an application exhaustion flood [T1499.003] by sending sustained requests with oversized files to the organization's image processing service, degrading performance and causing service disruptions. System logs from affected servers showed increased CPU usage and failed login attempts, though these were not tagged as specific techniques. The campaign highlights the need for enhanced monitoring of physical media, network hardware, and cloud management tools in segmented environments.
