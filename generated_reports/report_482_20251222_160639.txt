### Summary
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the fictional threat actor Crimson Shadow in a recent simulated campaign against a mid-sized financial services firm, 'SecureFin Corp'. This report is intended for blue team training to enhance detection and response capabilities.

### Attack Narrative
**Initial Access:** Crimson Shadow actors conducted reconnaissance by collecting public posts from SecureFin Corp's Twitter account to identify key executives and their roles [T1593.001]. This information was used to craft targeted phishing emails, which led to a drive-by download exploiting a heap overflow vulnerability in the victim's browser to access and transmit host configuration details, including OS version and installed software [T1592].

**Execution and Persistence:** Upon gaining initial foothold, the actors used a compromised Exchange account to search mailboxes for sensitive information and create new Exchange accounts for persistent access [T1078]. Simultaneously, they leveraged compromised Azure Managed Identities to persistently access cloud databases, exfiltrating customer data and financial records [T1078.004]. To maintain control, they employed Unix shell commands like `Xcsh` or `Xcls` to open shells with elevated permissions and `Xxsh` for root-level access, enabling further exploitation [T1059.004].

**Defense Evasion and Collection:** The backdoor utilized base64 -d to decrypt its configuration data from a remote server after delivery, compiling it on the victim system to avoid static detection [T1027.004]. For network reconnaissance, malware used SNMP GET requests to collect routing table information from infrastructure devices, mapping internal network topology [T1602.001]. Additionally, malicious scripts queried Confluence repositories to extract API credentials stored in documentation, facilitating unauthorized access to internal systems [T1213].

**Exfiltration and Command and Control:** To capture sensitive audio, spyware silently enabled the webcam to record video of document handling sessions, though no actual audio was logged in system events [T1123]. For obfuscation, traffic was routed over Tor and VPN servers in a multi-hop proxy chain to conceal command and control communications and data exfiltration activities [T1090.003].

### Background and Noise
SecureFin Corp, founded in 2005, specializes in online banking services with offices in New York and London. During the incident, system logs showed routine maintenance activities, such as scheduled backups and software updates, which were unrelated to the attack. Internal monitoring tools flagged unusual SNMP traffic but initially attributed it to network misconfigurations. The company's incident response team noted that the attack coincided with a planned IT infrastructure upgrade, complicating initial analysis.
