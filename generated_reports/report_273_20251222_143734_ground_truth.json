    "clean_text": "Ember Bear, a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has been observed conducting a multi-phase campaign against technology and financial sectors. Initial reconnaissance involved scanning public repositories for exploitation scripts against known vulnerabilities, while spear-phishing campaigns delivered weaponized Excel documents with embedded macros and created fake Pinterest boards with malicious links claiming free design templates. Upon execution, the adversary employed Lua scripts through a Windows interpreter to download malicious payloads, including a keylogger DLL injected into winlogon.exe using mavinject.exe. Privilege escalation was achieved by exploiting world-writable configuration files and abusing sudo to run privileged processes without authentication. In cloud environments, the actor executed 'docker exec -it container_name /bin/bash' to gain shell access and edited Apache configurations to add SSLEngine on with a malicious certificate file. For evasion, the malware modified sleep times from default 20-22 seconds and collected system time data. Network activities included using AWS Traffic Mirroring to sniff unencrypted credentials and leveraging SNMP to dump firewall rule sets. Data exfiltration involved stealing web session cookies and extracting code-signing certificates from the Windows store to sign malicious executables, with all C2 communications encrypted by BITTER malware. Logs from affected systems show increased network traffic and unauthorized access attempts, though some entries were unrelated to user login failures.",
