    "clean_text": "On October 15, 2023, Crimson Serpent compromised the CI/CD pipeline of a software vendor, injecting a malicious DLL into build dependencies to distribute trojanized updates to downstream customers. Upon execution in a victim environment, the malware used Visual Basic Script (VBS) to establish persistence by modifying rc.common to run a hidden service at boot while simultaneously attempting to authenticate to the domain controller using the built-in Administrator account with a weak default password. The actor then dropped and executed password-cracking tools like Hydra to brute-force additional credentials and utilized compromised internal routers as proxies to pivot between corporate and restricted network segments. In cloud environments, Crimson Serpent employed 'az ad user list' commands to export all Azure AD user objects and queried the Microsoft Teams API to collect authentication tokens, while also scanning GitHub commit histories for exposed .env files to harvest sensitive environment variables. System logs from the affected domain controller showed routine authentication failures unrelated to the attack, and the victim organization, a mid-sized financial services firm, had recently migrated legacy applications to Azure without implementing multi-factor authentication, contributing to the breach's scope. The campaign resulted in the exfiltration of proprietary code and customer data, with indicators of compromise including unusual network traffic patterns and unauthorized access to cloud administrative consoles.",

The campaign involves multi-stage payloads, credential harvesting, and lateral movement across hybrid environments, including cloud services and messaging platforms, to exfiltrate sensitive data and maintain persistence.",
