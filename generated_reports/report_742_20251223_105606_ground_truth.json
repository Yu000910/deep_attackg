    "clean_text": "Crimson Shadow actors likely initiated their campaign by conducting reconnaissance on target networks, using nmap.exe to enumerate hardware information from remote systems. Subsequently, they exploited external remote services by initiating connections to the company's VPN with harvested employee credentials, while simultaneously employing Python scripting to execute additional commands and enumerate cloud infrastructure to identify servers, backup management systems, and storage containers. The malware then made ListObjectsV2 requests to the S3 API to catalog files in compromised buckets, and using stolen credentials, the threat actor accessed cloud infrastructure via Azure Serial Console to bypass network security controls. To maintain access, the actors imported browser session data to hijack authenticated sessions and bypass multi-factor authentication, while the malware bypassed egress filtering by querying DNS MX records with hidden data. Finally, Linfo created a backdoor through which remote attackers could change the frequency at which compromised hosts contact remote C2 infrastructure. System logs from the fictional company 'TechGlobal Inc.' showed unusual network traffic spikes during off-hours, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to misconfigured monitoring tools. TechGlobal Inc., a mid-sized technology firm with operations in North America and Europe, reported no actual data loss, but this scenario highlights vulnerabilities in their cloud security posture.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group, designated as 'Crimson Shadow,' targeting organizations with hybrid cloud environments. The campaign leverages credential harvesting, cloud discovery, and stealthy command-and-control (C2) techniques to exfiltrate sensitive data and maintain persistence. Blue teams should use this report for training to identify and mitigate similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).",
