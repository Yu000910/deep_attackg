On October 26, 2024, APT-99 initiated a campaign against GlobalTech Inc., a technology firm with offices in North America and Europe, using a compromised Teensy USB device delivered via a hardware supply chain to an employee in the finance department [T1195.003]. The device simulated keystrokes to execute a PowerShell script that downloaded and installed a reverse shell payload, which then abused svchost.exe to run malicious commands through Windows services while simultaneously modifying registry keys to establish persistence [T1569]. Following initial compromise, the adversary conducted reconnaissance by searching Slack Workflows for exposed webhook URLs with access tokens and using 'esxcli network vm list' to identify running virtual machines along with their network configurations [T1552.008, T1673]. The malware, identified as a variant of Cuckoo Stealer, collected bookmarks, cookies, and history from Safari browsers on infected macOS systems, and the attacker leveraged GCP Command Center to discover cloud resources lacking proper security controls, such as unsecured storage buckets and misconfigured firewalls [T1217, T1538]. For lateral movement, APT-99 employed an Outlook VBA module on compromised systems to send spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to other employees within the organization, and imported cookie files from the victim's browser profiles to hijack authenticated web sessions while executing dhcpspoof.exe to poison the network with fraudulent DHCP responses [T1534, T1550.004, T1557.003]. Throughout the campaign, the group used one-way communication channels, obtaining instructions for further actions from a Twitter account, and maintained command and control via encrypted HTTPS traffic to a domain registered shortly before the attack [T1102.003]. Logs from the affected Windows servers showed unusual spikes in network activity at 03:00 UTC, coinciding with the DHCP spoofing events, but no alerts were triggered due to misconfigured SIEM rules. GlobalTech's incident response team, upon investigation, noted that the initial USB device was part of a batch ordered from a third-party supplier with known security lapses, highlighting supply chain risks.
