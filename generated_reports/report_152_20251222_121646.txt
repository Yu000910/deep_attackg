The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform blue teams about a fictional APT campaign for training purposes. Crimson Viper actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify vulnerable infrastructure. In the observed scenario, the attackers exploited misconfigured SMTP settings on an email server [T1584.004] to gain administrative access, which they used to deploy malware while simultaneously leveraging compromised credentials to access the corporate VPN [T1133]. System logs from the target organization, 'GlobalTech Inc.', showed unusual login attempts from IP addresses in Eastern Europe, though these were later determined to be spoofed. The actors then employed RemoteExec, a software deployment tool [T1072], to execute malicious scripts across the network and create hidden user accounts [T1564.002] using dscl to evade detection. Additionally, they modified boot configuration data with bcdedit.exe to disable security software in Safe Mode [T1562.009] and performed brute force attacks [T1110] on internal systems to escalate privileges. For data exfiltration, the malware used legitimate OAuth refresh tokens [T1550.001] to authenticate with cloud services like OneDrive and established Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions [T1021.001] to maintain access. Communication with command-and-control servers was conducted via POP3 mail protocols [T1071.003], with the backdoor periodically checking a designated inbox for new commands. Background information on GlobalTech Inc. indicates they are a mid-sized manufacturing firm with outdated patch management policies, but this is unrelated to the attack vector. The campaign concluded with ransomware deployment, though no actual data loss occurred in this training exercise.
