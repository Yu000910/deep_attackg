    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide blue teams with training on a fictional APT campaign. ShadowNet actors likely conduct reconnaissance by scanning network security appliances using tools like nmap to identify vulnerable devices and map network topology. Following this, the actors sent spear-phishing emails with malicious PDF attachments exploiting known vulnerabilities to gain initial access. Upon execution, the malware exploited container environments by sending kubectl commands through an IRC channel to manipulate victim clusters and spread laterally, while also modifying Outlook registry entries to load a malicious HTML page for persistent access via email clients. The actors then escalated privileges by modifying Group Policy objects to include credential harvesting commands that execute during GPO processing, and hijacked vDSO functions to redirect execution flow to attacker-controlled code, evading detection. To maintain stealth, they disabled monitoring tools by altering DNS resolvers and patched system images by downloading configuration files via TFTP to modify network device parameters. For credential access, the actors performed Kerberoasting attacks to decode Kerberos tickets and convert them for offline cracking, while using GUI input capture to prompt users for credentials directly. Finally, command and control was established using one-way communication via Telegram Messenger to discover C2 IP addresses. Throughout the campaign, system logs showed normal user activity, and the targeted organization, 'SecureBank Inc.', reported no initial anomalies, highlighting the need for enhanced monitoring and training.",
