The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign, designated APT-FICT. This campaign targets macOS users in corporate and personal environments, exploiting public Wi-Fi networks to initiate attacks. APT-FICT actors likely conduct reconnaissance on open Wi-Fi networks at locations such as coffee shops to identify vulnerable targets [T1669]. Upon establishing initial access, the adversary employs dlopen to load a malicious shared object containing backdoor functionality [T1129] while simultaneously modifying the Mach-O binary's load commands to include a path to a malicious dylib for persistence [T1546.006]. System logs from affected devices show unusual network traffic patterns, including connections to unknown IP addresses, though these logs are not directly indicative of the attack. The malware then executes NBTscan to list active users on the system for discovery purposes [T1033], and dynamically registers a new DNS A record pointing to its command-and-control server using fast flux DNS techniques to evade detection [T1568.001]. Background checks on the fictional company, TechCorp Inc., reveal no prior incidents, but internal monitoring flagged anomalous outbound traffic during routine audits. The campaign demonstrates a multi-stage approach combining initial access via Wi-Fi, execution through shared modules, persistence via load command modifications, user discovery, and resilient C2 communication.
