Background: The fictional APT group 'ShadowHook' has been observed targeting mid-sized financial firms in North America since early 2024, with incidents reported involving unauthorized access to customer databases. Initial analysis suggests the actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] through social media and public financial records, though no specific techniques are confirmed in this scenario. The attack begins with a phishing campaign where adversaries send emails with attached password-protected ZIP files containing malware [T1566], specifically using spearphishing links [T1566.002] that redirect to malicious domains hosting Emotet-like payloads. Upon execution, the malware exploits an XPC service daemon's weak authentication to gain unauthorized elevated system access [T1559.003], allowing the actors to establish persistence by modifying HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify to trigger malicious code execution during the Windows logon process [T1547.004]. System logs from infected hosts show unusual registry modifications at 03:45 UTC, but these were not flagged by standard antivirus software. Concurrently, the actors employ LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning and SMB relay [T1557.001] to sniff plaintext network credentials and facilitate lateral movement across the network, while C2 communications are masked using a Tor gateway to anonymize the traffic [T1665] and receive encrypted commands from C2 servers [T1573]. The company, 'SecureFin Corp', reported no prior breaches, but internal audits revealed outdated patch management processes. Additional noise includes routine firewall logs showing blocked connections from non-malicious IPs during the attack period.
