Background: The fictional company 'InfraSecure Corp.', a mid-sized energy provider, reported anomalous network activity during routine security audits in Q3 2024. Logs indicated unauthorized access from external IP addresses, prompting an investigation that revealed a coordinated attack campaign.

Attack Scenario: ShadowLink actors initiated the campaign by conducting reconnaissance on InfraSecure's public-facing systems, identifying weak Wi-Fi access points in remote office locations [T1669]. They exploited default credentials to gain initial access via a compromised employee account, leveraging valid credentials extracted from previous breaches [T1078]. Once inside, the actors used inter-process communication mechanisms, such as named pipes, to execute malicious commands covertly within the system [T1559]. To maintain persistence, they modified cron jobs to schedule data exfiltration scripts every hour, ensuring continuous operation [T1053.003], and added malicious entries to RC scripts for reboot persistence, embedding payloads in /etc/rc.local [T1037.004]. For privilege escalation, the actors exploited sudo caching vulnerabilities by editing the /etc/sudoers file to grant unrestricted admin access without passwords [T1548.003], and hijacked execution flow through DLL side-loading, targeting svchost.exe to bypass security controls [T1574]. They further evaded detection by injecting malicious code into winlogon.exe using portable executable injection techniques [T1055.002] and tampering with security logging configurations via PowerShell scripts to disable audit trails [T1211]. For lateral movement, the actors employed alternate authentication material, performing Pass-the-Hash attacks with collected password hashes to access domain controllers and other critical systems [T1550]. Command and control was established using web protocols over HTTP for communication with external servers [T1071.001], and non-standard ports above 30,000 were utilized to obscure traffic and avoid detection by network monitoring tools [T1571]. System logs from InfraSecure showed increased outbound traffic to unknown IPs during off-hours, but no actual data loss occurred in this training scenario.

Recommendations: Blue teams should monitor for unusual cron job modifications, unauthorized sudoers changes, and anomalous network traffic on non-standard ports. Implement multi-factor authentication and regular credential audits to mitigate risks associated with valid account abuse.
