Crimson Viper initiated operations by conducting reconnaissance to determine physical office locations [T1591.001] and scanning IP blocks with ICMP timestamp requests to assess network device availability [T1595.001]. The actors then established fake social media accounts using stolen personal information [T1585] and acquired infrastructure through marketing platforms like HubSpot to obscure phishing email origins [T1583]. They leveraged external remote services by exploiting VPN profiles and OWA credentials to gain initial access [T1133], followed by deploying a container to execute malicious payloads [T1610]. For persistence, they used BITS jobs to launch processes [T1197] and replicated through removable media to breach secure environments [T1091]. Data exfiltration involved targeting cloud storage, where malware collected unencrypted financial records from exposed Amazon S3 buckets [T1530], while multi-stage channels established SOCKS5 connections for command and control [T1104]. The campaign culminated in application exhaustion floods that executed sustained requests to image processing services, causing rendering delays [T1499.003]. Logs from the victim's SIEM showed routine system updates at 03:00 UTC, unrelated to the attack, and the organization's background in regional banking with offices in three cities was used in targeting.
