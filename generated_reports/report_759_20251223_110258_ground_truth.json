    "clean_text": "### Background\nShadow Harvest is a fictional advanced persistent threat (APT) group assessed to be state-sponsored, with objectives focused on espionage and disruption in critical infrastructure. This report is based on a simulated incident at a fictional energy company, 'GridPower Inc.', where anomalous network traffic was detected on internal servers. Logs from the affected systems show increased CPU usage and unauthorized outbound connections to pastebin.com, though initial alerts were dismissed as false positives due to scheduled maintenance activities. GridPower Inc. operates across North America with over 5,000 employees and relies on legacy SCADA systems, which were not directly compromised in this scenario.\n\n### Attack Narrative\n**Initial Access:** The actors likely conducted reconnaissance by querying public APIs to identify corporate email addresses and performed active scanning using tools like nmap.exe to map network services on exposed systems. They gained initial access by exploiting a public-facing application vulnerability, specifically CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices, and sent phishing emails with malicious Excel files containing embedded PowerShell scripts.\n\n**Execution and Persistence:** Upon user interaction, the adversaries employed Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) in Word documents to execute PowerShell commands, which downloaded and deobfuscated AES-encrypted payloads from remote servers. The malware then used time-based evasion by sleeping for specified intervals to avoid detection and transferred additional tools, such as web shells, to paths like C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\system_web\\IISpool.aspx.\n\n**Discovery and Collection:** The actors conducted peripheral device discovery by dropping plugins to monitor external drives and performed network sniffing to hook application filter chains and inspect inbound requests for sensitive parameters like passwords. They replicated through removable media by modifying drives to use Autorun for execution and collected email data by executing Outlook.exe to access calendar entries, as well as remotely collecting emails from compromised Azure AD tenants via Exchange Web Services (EWS) API requests.\n\n**Exfiltration and Impact:** Data was exfiltrated to text storage sites like pastebin.com for later retrieval, and the actors used reflection amplification by sending monlist packets from compromised systems to generate traffic. Finally, they encrypted files for impact using the Mbed Crypto library with generated AES keys, though in this simulation, the encryption was halted before widespread damage. System logs from GridPower Inc. show no evidence of data loss, but network administrators reported intermittent latency spikes during the campaign, which were attributed to routine backup processes.\n\n### Recommendations\nBlue teams should monitor for unusual API queries, scanning activity, and phishing indicators. Implement application whitelisting, network segmentation, and regular patching of public-facing systems. Use this report in training exercises to enhance detection and response capabilities against similar TTPs.",
