On October 15, 2023, multiple technology firms reported suspicious activity indicative of a coordinated cyber intrusion. The adversary, CrimsonShadow, likely conducted reconnaissance on underground forums to obtain capabilities [T1588], specifically acquiring a remote access trojan (RAT) [T1588.001] and a credential harvesting tool [T1588]. Initial access was achieved through spear-phishing emails with malicious PDF attachments exploiting known vulnerabilities [T1566], while simultaneously compromising a continuous integration server to inject credential-stealing malware into production builds [T1195]. Upon execution, the malware employed inter-process communication via shared memory to coordinate with a custom Tor client [T1559] and bypass macOS Gatekeeper by removing quarantine attributes [T1553.001]. The actors then performed discovery activities, using PowerShell scripts to identify software versions like Internet Explorer [T1518], enumerate open application windows [T1010], and collect network configuration details including IP addresses and domain names [T1016]. For lateral movement, they utilized alternate authentication material through Pass-the-Hash techniques [T1550] and executed cloud administration commands via Azure Run Command to deploy payloads on virtual machines [T1651]. Credential theft was enhanced by hooking APIs to monitor browser traffic [T1056.004], and remote access was maintained using legitimate TeamViewer applications [T1219.002]. To obscure exfiltration, traffic signaling redirected clients to legitimate web pages [T1205], while stolen data was exfiltrated to OneDrive cloud storage [T1567.002]. System logs from affected hosts showed increased network traffic and unauthorized process creations, though some entries were benign updates from internal software repositories. Company background checks revealed no prior incidents, but outdated patch management was noted in post-incident reviews.
