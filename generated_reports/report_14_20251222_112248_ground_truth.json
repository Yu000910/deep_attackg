    "clean_text": "On April 15, 2024, multiple energy companies reported suspicious activity linked to a campaign dubbed 'Night Dragon.' The actors likely conducted reconnaissance to identify high-value targets. Initial access was achieved through a malicious spam campaign, where employees received emails with weaponized attachments disguised as invoices. Once executed, the malware leveraged compromised domain accounts to move laterally across the network, using Unix shell scripts to establish persistence via event-triggered execution, such as modifying cron jobs to invoke malicious payloads. System checks were performed to detect sandbox environments, ensuring evasion. Command and control communications occurred over non-standard ports, like UDP 5900, to bypass network monitoring. Data exfiltration involved encrypting stolen files with OpenSSL and uploading them to a cloud service, while simultaneously exploiting Bluetooth pairing weaknesses to transfer credentials to nearby devices. Logs from affected systems show increased CPU usage and unusual outbound traffic, though some entries were benign administrative tasks unrelated to the attack. The campaign's sophistication suggests coordination with advanced persistent threat groups, though attribution remains inconclusive.",
