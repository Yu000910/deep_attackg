    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide insights into a fictional APT campaign dubbed 'Operation Dream Job'. DreamWeaver actors likely conducted reconnaissance to identify high-value targets, including employees in HR and IT departments. Initial access was achieved through a spearphishing campaign that delivered malicious attachments, which, when opened, executed PowerShell scripts to drop payloads and establish persistence. Concurrently, the actors compromised third-party servers to host command-and-control (C2) infrastructure and malicious tools, while also injecting malicious code into a widely used open-source library dependency, affecting thousands of applications in the supply chain. Upon gaining access, DreamWeaver utilized cloud administration commands, such as Azure Run Command, to execute code on virtual machines and escalate privileges, while employing malware to dump securityd memory and recover plaintext credentials from keychains. The actors then conducted discovery activities, using tools like netstat to gather information about local network connections and identify critical assets. For data exfiltration, DreamWeaver leveraged removable media, such as USB sticks, to transfer data from air-gapped systems, and exfiltrated collected information over C2 channels via HTTP POST requests to hardcoded URLs. Finally, in a destructive phase, the actors executed disk wipe commands to delete user profiles and system backups, maximizing operational downtime. Throughout the campaign, DreamWeaver maintained stealth by blending malicious traffic with normal system logs, such as routine backup processes and user login attempts, which were not indicative of compromise. The group's tactics reflect a sophisticated blend of social engineering, technical exploitation, and operational security designed to evade traditional defenses.",
