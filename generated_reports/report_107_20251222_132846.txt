On April 15, 2024, a fictional financial institution, 'SecureBank Corp,' reported anomalous activity after executives received spear-phishing emails with trojanized PDF attachments, leading to initial compromise [T1566]. The malware, upon execution, established persistence by modifying the StubPath value in an Active Setup component to ensure automatic reload after system reboots [T1547.014] and used launchctl to load a malicious service at boot on macOS systems, ensuring continuous operation [T1569.001]. System logs from SecureBank's SIEM showed unusual process spawns from explorer.exe, but these were initially dismissed as benign. The actors then laterally moved within the network by hijacking an established remote desktop connection using tscon.exe to gain unauthorized access to critical servers [T1563.002] and leveraged Azure RunCommand to deploy backdoors across virtual machines in the cloud environment, expanding their foothold [T1651]. Concurrently, the malware injected a malicious DLL into explorer.exe to obfuscate command and control (C2) communications, evading network detection [T1001], and utilized stolen application access tokens to query REST endpoints, mapping the organization's digital infrastructure for further exploitation [T1550.001]. SecureBank's incident response team noted encrypted files and ransom notes demanding payment in cryptocurrency, with threats to publish exfiltrated sensitive data if demands were not met, illustrating financial theft motives [T1657]. Background checks revealed no prior incidents at SecureBank, but internal audits flagged outdated patch management processes. The campaign concluded with simulated data exfiltration and ransomware deployment, highlighting the need for enhanced monitoring and response protocols.
