The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on the fictional APT group CrimsonViper, which has been observed targeting financial organizations in a simulated training exercise. CrimsonViper actors likely conduct reconnaissance [T1589] to identify vulnerable web servers. In the initial access phase, they exploited a compromised website by injecting malicious JavaScript code [T1608.005] to capture user credentials, which were then used to gain unauthorized access via valid accounts [T1078]. Once inside the network, the actors established persistence by creating scheduled tasks [T1053.005] to maintain long-term access and used shared modules [T1129] like LoadLibrary to execute GdiPlus.dll for stealthy operations. For lateral movement, they deployed web shells [T1505.003] on internal servers and employed template injection [T1221] by embedding SMB URLs into malicious documents to force authentication and expand their foothold. During post-compromise activities, the actors conducted discovery by parsing bash history [T1552.003] to extract AWS CLI commands and access keys, while also performing device driver discovery [T1652] using EnumDeviceDrivers() to monitor system changes and remote system discovery [T1018] via LDAP queries to identify connected workstations. Additionally, they queried Confluence pages [T1213.001] to access database schemas and connection strings, and all data exfiltration was conducted over encrypted channels [T1573] using RSA public-key cryptography to evade detection. System logs from the victim's environment showed normal traffic patterns during off-hours, with no immediate alerts triggered, highlighting the need for enhanced monitoring. The organization, a mid-sized bank with legacy infrastructure, reported no actual financial loss in this training scenario, but the exercise underscored vulnerabilities in their web application security and credential management practices.
