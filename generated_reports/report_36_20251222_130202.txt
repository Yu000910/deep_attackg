On 2024-10-01, Acme Corp, a fictional manufacturing company with 500 employees, reported anomalous network activity to the FBI, CISA, and NSA. Initial logs from their SIEM showed failed login attempts on a Windows domain controller, which were later traced to a compromised vendor account. The actors, likely operating from IP addresses in the 203.0.113.0/24 range, conducted reconnaissance by enumerating user accounts [T1087] through commands like 'cat /etc/passwd' on Linux servers, and then used hard-coded domain credentials [T1078.002] to access network shares when initial privileges were insufficient. After gaining a foothold, they executed malicious PowerShell scripts that loaded shared modules [T1129] via LoadLibrary calls to download additional tools, which were used to dump Security Account Manager (SAM) hashes [T1003.002] from local Windows systems using pwdumpx.exe with administrative rights. For lateral movement, the adversaries activated SSH services [T1021.004] on virtual infrastructure by running 'vim-cmd hostsvc/start_ssh' and abused TeamViewer [T1219.002] to establish covert interactive channels, while simultaneously staging collected data from applications like Safari and Keychain to local directories [T1074.001] such as '/var/folder'. The campaign culminated in exfiltration over web services [T1567] using PowerShell scripts to upload system configuration files and an OS exhaustion flood [T1499.001] via ACK floods against a database server to degrade its processing capacity. Acme Corp's internal investigation noted unrelated system reboots and high CPU usage on non-critical servers, which were not linked to the attack.
