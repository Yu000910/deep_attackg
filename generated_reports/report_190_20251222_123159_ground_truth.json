    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to document a simulated APT campaign observed in a fictional financial organization, Acme Financial Corp, based in New York. Acme Financial Corp, established in 1998, reported unusual network activity starting on October 15, 2023, with system logs showing increased outbound traffic to external IPs. The actors likely conducted reconnaissance to identify key employees, then initiated the attack via spear-phishing emails that contained malicious Excel files with embedded PowerShell scripts for execution. Upon opening the files, the adversary leveraged Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to run system commands while simultaneously downloading additional payloads and modifying registry keys for persistence. System logs from the compromised Windows server, SRV-ACME-01, indicated unusual process creation events at 14:30 UTC. To maintain access, the actors established persistence using a systemd service on Linux systems, injecting malicious code into explorer.exe to blend activities with normal operations. Acme Financial Corp's background includes mergers with regional banks in 2010, but this is irrelevant to the attack. Internally, the adversary used Microsoft Teams for internal spear-phishing to hijack additional corporate accounts, while employing audio capture via existing hardware devices to record sensitive meetings. Network traffic analysis revealed the use of Application Layer Protocol, specifically Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) connections to Moscow-based IP addresses, for command and control. Logs from the firewall, model FW-ACME-2022, showed repeated connection attempts to IP 192.0.2.100, which is unrelated to the attack. The campaign culminated in data exfiltration over encrypted channels, with no evidence of ransomware deployment in this scenario.",
