ShadowGather actors initiated their campaign by purchasing a list of vulnerable systems from a dark web marketplace [T1597.002], which they then used to conduct reconnaissance by scanning IP blocks [T1595.001] to identify active network nodes and determine physical locations [T1591.001] of targeted executives via social media queries. Subsequently, the actors compromised the software supply chain by altering a continuous integration pipeline to bundle spyware with legitimate updates [T1195], enabling initial access. Once inside, they established persistence by creating a scheduled task [T1053] that executed a remote access tool every 15 minutes and registered a malicious DLL as a port monitor [T1547.010] using the AddMonitor API. To escalate privileges, the malware edited the TCC.db file to authorize accessibility access for a keylogger [T1548.006] and impersonated a domain admin user token [T1134.003] by invoking SetThreadToken. The actors then conducted discovery operations, querying the Docker API to uncover container resource limits and requests [T1613] while automatically collecting data [T1119] from compromised systems. For credential theft, they deployed a fake corporate intranet portal that transparently logged all entered credentials [T1056] and queried SharePoint for password-protected documents containing proprietary information [T1213.002]. Exfiltration was achieved through DNS-based command and control communications [T1071.004] using IPv4 A and IPv6 AAAA records, and data was moved from airgapped networks to Internet-connected systems via removable USB devices [T1052.001]. Throughout the campaign, system logs showed routine network traffic spikes and failed login attempts from unrecognized IP addresses, though these were initially dismissed as false positives. The targeted organization, a fictional energy company with operations across North America, reported no significant disruptions, but post-incident analysis revealed extensive data loss.
