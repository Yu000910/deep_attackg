The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide actionable intelligence on a fictional APT campaign, 'SilentVector', observed targeting critical infrastructure organizations. This report is based on a simulated attack scenario for educational purposes, incorporating realistic but fictitious elements to train defensive teams. The campaign begins with initial access where actors conduct reconnaissance [T1598.002] by sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to key personnel, while simultaneously compromising a software supply chain [T1195.002] by replacing a legitimate binary on a distribution server with a trojanized version. Upon execution, the adversary employs Unix shell commands [T1059.004] to survey compromised Linux systems and gather sensitive information, concurrently using AppleScript [T1059.002] on macOS devices to generate deceptive prompts and manipulate files. For persistence and C2, the malware implements port knocking [T1205.001] to establish hidden raw socket connections, and abuses web services [T1102] by embedding exfiltrated credentials into search queries via Google's API. System logs from a fictional victim, 'InfraCorp', show unusual network traffic spikes and unauthorized file modifications, though some entries are benign noise from routine maintenance. Background: InfraCorp is a mid-sized energy provider with hybrid cloud infrastructure, and this scenario assumes prior security audits revealed no critical vulnerabilities. The actors' tactics demonstrate a blend of cross-platform exploitation and stealth, emphasizing the need for robust monitoring and incident response protocols.
