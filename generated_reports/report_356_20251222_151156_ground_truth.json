    "clean_text": "CrimsonShadow, a suspected state-sponsored group, initiated this campaign by establishing SSL certificates on typo-squatted domains to appear legitimate. The actors then conducted a drive-by compromise by injecting malicious JavaScript into a compromised financial news website, exploiting browser vulnerabilities to deliver initial payloads. Upon execution, the malware used JamPlus.exe to run malicious .jam files that installed a backdoor and employed process injection techniques to inject shared objects into web process memory, enabling further backdoor deployment. For persistence, the malware created a systemd timer to run data exfiltration scripts every 6 hours. The backdoor utilized libpcap with custom BPF filters to detect specific network packet sequences and implemented credential API hooking by installing a Windows hook to capture network drive attachments and call file-stealing methods. Additionally, a PowerShell script was executed to spawn a spoofed VPN connection prompt and capture corporate credentials via GUI input capture. The actors used stolen domain account credentials to authenticate on target networks and granted additional email delegate permissions using PowerShell cmdlets to impersonate compromised accounts. Data collection included local email archives exfiltrated by RAT malware and screen captures from victim machines. To evade detection, the custom C2 client encoded commands using base64 with junk data. Network attacks involved DHCP spoofing to exhaust legitimate pools and introduce rogue servers. The campaign culminated in financial theft through business email compromise, requesting gift card purchases from employees. System logs from affected servers showed unusual spikes in network traffic, but no critical alerts were triggered during initial phases. The targeted company, FinSecure Inc., reported minor disruptions in email services, attributed to routine maintenance.",
