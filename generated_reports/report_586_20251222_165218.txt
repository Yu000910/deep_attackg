On January 15, 2024, security teams at 'CloudTech Solutions', a fictional mid-sized cloud service provider, detected anomalous activity in their production environment. The company, which offers SaaS applications and hybrid cloud management, had recently migrated legacy systems to Kubernetes clusters on Azure. Initial logs showed increased traffic to an Apache Struts instance running on a public-facing web server, with unusual payloads targeting a known vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638). The actors likely conducted reconnaissance to identify this weakness, though no specific TTPs were logged in this phase. Subsequently, the adversary exploited the Apache Struts vulnerability [T1190] to gain initial access, delivering a malicious VBS script that executed upon successful exploitation [T1059.005]. Once inside, they leveraged Azure Serial Console to establish direct connections to virtual machines [T1021.008], where they configured a malicious CronJob in the Kubernetes cluster to deploy a container for data exfiltration during off-peak hours [T1053.007]. To evade detection, the custom command and control client mimicked legitimate Azure API traffic patterns by injecting junk data into network packets [T1001.001], and exfiltrated sensitive data over an open WiFi network set up as a rogue access point within the cloud environment [T1011]. Incident responders noted that system logs from the affected VMs showed sporadic errors unrelated to the attack, such as failed backup jobs and high memory usage alerts, which were later determined to be benign. The campaign was contained after 72 hours, with no real data loss reported in this training scenario.
