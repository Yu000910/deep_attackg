Crimson Lotus actors likely conduct reconnaissance through open-source intelligence gathering [T1589] to identify key employees at targeted financial organizations. The campaign began with a phishing email campaign [T1566] that distributed malicious ZIP file attachments containing ransomware payloads, while simultaneously using spearphishing links [T1566.002] in emails to redirect victims to compromised websites hosting additional malware. Upon execution, the adversaries employed PowerShell [T1059.001] to actively download and execute malicious scripts [T1105] from command-and-control servers, while simultaneously modifying system configurations [T1112] to establish persistence. To maintain elevated access, they exploited installer packages [T1546.016] by placing a malicious executable in the postinstall script directory, ensuring it ran with administrative privileges during software updates, and then leveraged Remote Desktop Protocol [T1021.001] to enable remote access on compromised machines for lateral movement. During lateral movement, the actors conducted a Pass-the-Hash attack [T1550] to bypass authentication controls and access sensitive file shares, while simultaneously using IDE tunneling [T1219.001] to create a persistent backdoor that relayed command-and-control traffic through legitimate development tools. To evade detection, they employed protocol impersonation [T1001.003] by hiding C2 data within HTTP Referer headers to mimic regular web browsing patterns. System logs from affected networks show increased PowerShell activity and unusual RDP connections from external IP addresses, but no evidence of data exfiltration was confirmed in this fictional scenario. The targeted organization, 'Global Finance Corp', reported no financial losses, as this was part of a controlled training exercise.
