The campaign involves sophisticated reconnaissance, initial access via spearphishing, execution through multiple vectors, persistence mechanisms, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, lateral movement, collection, command and control, and exfiltration. Techniques are mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework for blue team training purposes.",
