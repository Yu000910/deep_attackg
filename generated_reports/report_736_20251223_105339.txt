The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to report on a simulated advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign, designated FICT-2024-001, targeting financial organizations. This fictional scenario is designed for training blue teams in detecting and mitigating multi-stage attacks. Actors likely conduct reconnaissance by searching closed sources [T1597], such as business databases like RocketReach and CrunchBase, to gather intelligence on key employees and organizational structures. Initial access was achieved through exploitation of default accounts [T1078.001], leveraging hardcoded credentials in database servers, while simultaneously using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) [T1047] to execute encoded PowerShell scripts via the DownloadString method and modify administrative settings on remote hosts for lateral movement. Execution involved abusing executable installer file permissions weaknesses [T1574.005], with a script locating installer.exe in the Windows directory to run malicious code with elevated privileges, and installing a malicious digital certificate [T1608.003] by modifying the Apache httpd.conf file to include SSLCertificateFile directives, thereby facilitating man-in-the-middle attacks. Persistence was maintained through multi-factor authentication (MFA) tampering [T1556.006], where the malware altered the hosts file to intercept and drop packets destined for MFA servers, and lateral movement was enhanced via SSH hijacking [T1563.001], exploiting misconfigured SSH public key authentication to traverse the network. Command and control (C2) utilized web services [T1102], such as Pastebin, to receive commands, and one-way communication methods [T1102.003] via platforms like GitLab and Digital Point for stealthy data exfiltration. Impact culminated in a denial-of-service attack through OS exhaustion floods [T1499.001], with the malware initiating a SYN flood script against port 80 to disrupt legitimate user access. System logs from affected servers show increased network traffic and failed authentication attempts, though some entries are unrelated to the attack, such as routine backup processes and user login errors from misconfigured applications. The organization, a mid-sized bank with operations across North America, reported no actual financial loss in this training exercise, but the simulation highlights critical vulnerabilities in default configurations and weak authentication mechanisms.
