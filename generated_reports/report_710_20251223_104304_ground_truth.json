    "clean_text": "On October 15, 2023, VoltGrid Inc. reported anomalous network activity, prompting an investigation that revealed a coordinated cyber intrusion. The company, based in Houston, Texas, specializes in renewable energy grid management, with systems logging routine operational data every 5 minutes. The threat actor, designated 'ShadowScrape', initiated reconnaissance by scanning IP blocks using hping3 to identify vulnerable hosts while simultaneously gathering victim org information through Twitter searches for executives' public posts about upcoming projects. Initial access was achieved by exploiting a web shell on an outdated web server, which the actors had planted after acquiring access through a default Guest account with a weak password identified via common lists. Execution involved deploying a malicious VBA macro in a spear-phishing Excel document that executed an AutoOpen subroutine to download payloads from a serverless AWS Lambda function, proxying traffic through trusted AWS IP ranges to evade detection. Privilege escalation was performed by exploiting CVE-2021-1732 to gain SYSTEM-level rights, followed by modifying registry keys using reg add for persistence and employing portable executable injection via WriteProcessMemory to inject malicious code into a legitimate system process. Defense evasion included indicator blocking through NtSetInformationProcess to suppress Windows error messages. Discovery activities involved network service discovery using the Hunter tool to map vulnerable systems and cloud account enumeration via 'az ad user list' to target enabled Azure Active Directory users. Credential access was achieved through a web portal capture that redirected login codes to a controlled site and an evil twin attack deploying a counterfeit authentication portal on the local network to intercept credentials. Collection efforts staged data by compiling network scan results into a compressed folder using cmd.exe, with exfiltration conducted through removable media via USB flash drives from an air-gapped network segment. System logs from VoltGrid's SIEM showed increased outbound traffic to AWS IPs, but no immediate alerts were triggered due to the trusted proxy setup.",
