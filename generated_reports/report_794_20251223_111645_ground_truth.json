    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide training on a fictional Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaign attributed to 'ShadowNet', a simulated actor targeting financial sectors and cloud infrastructure. Initial reconnaissance involved the actor searching public exploit repositories for known vulnerabilities in the target's VPN solution, leading to unauthorized access. Upon gaining entry, ShadowNet deployed unique malware designed for information theft and exfiltration, which was delivered via a malicious Amazon Machine Image with pre-installed keylogging software dropped into the victim's cloud environment. Concurrently, the security team discovered a passive network tap that had been collecting data for weeks without triggering alerts, indicating prolonged surveillance. For execution, the adversary used the Windows Command Shell to run commands and establish persistence by modifying Registry Run keys. To evade detection, ShadowNet employed process hollowing by hollowing out a legitimate process and injecting malicious code. For credential access and lateral movement, the actor created tokens using compromised SAML signing certificates and bypassed multi-factor authentication on victim email accounts by using stolen web session cookies. Data exfiltration involved transmitting stolen information using a modified Base64 encoding scheme, while the primary objective was financial theft, targeting organizations with the goal of monetary gain through techniques like banking trojans. Logs from affected systems showed increased network traffic to external IPs, but no alerts were triggered due to the hardware tap's passive nature. The victim organization, a mid-sized financial firm, reported unusual account activities and cloud resource usage spikes during this period, though initial investigations focused on misconfigurations rather than malicious intent.",

        "summary": "This advisory details a simulated campaign by the fictional threat actor 'ShadowNet', which targeted financial institutions and cloud environments to conduct reconnaissance, deploy malware, and execute financial theft. The campaign involved exploiting known vulnerabilities, deploying custom malware, and using hardware implants for data collection, followed by persistence mechanisms and data exfiltration with obfuscation techniques. Blue teams should review network logs, monitor for unusual hardware additions, and implement strict access controls to mitigate similar threats.",
