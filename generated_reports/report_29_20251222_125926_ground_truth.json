    "clean_text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, and NSA are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to inform defenders about a simulated APT campaign observed in a training environment targeting financial institutions. The campaign begins with the adversary conducting reconnaissance to identify key personnel and vendor relationships. In the Initial Access phase, the actor initiated a spearphishing voice call posing as IT support, tricking an employee into revealing their system credentials, which were then used to gain initial foothold. Leveraging a trusted relationship, the malicious actor exploited delegated administrative privileges from a third-party vendor to create new administrative accounts within the target organization's Active Directory, logging these actions in system logs that showed unusual account creation events at 14:30 UTC on 2023-10-05. During Execution, the adversary employed PowerShell to download the IcedID malware from a GitHub repository, which then used native APIs such as ZwWriteVirtualMemory and NtResumeThread to inject itself into a remote svchost.exe process while simultaneously querying the registry to enumerate keys and values for persistence configuration. In the Discovery phase, the actor conducted system network configuration discovery by running ipconfig/all and sending web beacons via email to gather details on network topology, and performed local email collection using PowerShell commands to locate and copy PST files from user profile directories, with logs indicating file access anomalies in the C:\\Users\\ directory. The campaign concluded with data exfiltration over web services, where collected data was uploaded to a controlled GitHub account, as noted in firewall logs showing outbound connections to github.com at 16:45 UTC. This scenario is purely educational and does not reflect real-world incidents.",
