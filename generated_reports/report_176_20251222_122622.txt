Background: On a simulated date in early 2024, a fictional mid-sized technology firm, 'InnovateCorp,' reported anomalous network activity originating from employee social media accounts. The firm's security team, during a routine blue team exercise, identified suspicious outbound connections to unknown email servers and unauthorized access to internal Slack workflows. This report is based on that simulated incident for training purposes.

Attack Narrative: The adversaries likely began by conducting vulnerability scanning [T1595.002] using tools like nmap to map InnovateCorp's external attack surface, identifying potentially exploitable applications such as outdated web servers. Following this, they executed spearphishing via service [T1566.003] by sending direct messages on Instagram to employees, impersonating friends with links to compromised photo albums that led to malicious downloads. Once initial access was gained, the actors employed native API [T1106] to load a backdoor, similar to FoggyWeb, into the application domain of legitimate processes, ensuring persistence while evading detection. To further obscure their activities, they ran a virtual instance [T1564.006] using /bin/vmx with elevated privileges, hiding reconnaissance tools from host-based security solutions. Concurrently, the threat actors searched chat messages [T1552.008] within Slack Workflows, scanning for plaintext passwords in workflow step definitions to harvest credentials for lateral movement. Finally, the backdoor utilized mail protocols [T1071.003] via POP3 to periodically check an operator-controlled email server for new commands, enabling stealthy command and control operations. Additional logs showed routine system updates and unrelated firewall alerts, which were not indicative of malicious activity.

Mitigation Recommendations: For training purposes, blue teams should monitor for unusual social media interactions, implement application allowlisting to restrict unauthorized API usage, enforce least privilege access on virtual environments, scan cloud workflows for exposed credentials, and inspect outbound mail traffic for anomalous POP3 connections.
