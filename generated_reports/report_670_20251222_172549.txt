Background: CrimsonTide, a state-sponsored APT group, targeted a fictional critical infrastructure organization, 'GlobalTech Solutions', which develops industrial control software. The initial breach occurred through a compromised third-party software vendor, where adversaries inserted trojanized components into a legitimate software update distributed to clients [T1195]. Upon installation, the malware initiated a spearphishing campaign, sending emails with malicious links that, when clicked, downloaded decoy documents containing loaders to execute payloads on victim systems [T1204.001]. Once established, the malware modified the ROMMON image on network routers to maintain persistence and evade detection [T1542.004], while also altering registry keys in HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment to load a malicious DLL into .NET processes for stealthy execution [T1574.012]. To expand control, the actors used DCShadow.exe to create unauthorized user accounts on domain controllers, mimicking legitimate administrative activity [T1207], and employed 'unset HISTFILE' commands on Linux systems to impair command history logging and obscure their actions [T1562.003]. For reconnaissance, the malware enumerated Kubernetes pods to discover containerized resources and assess the environment [T1613], and leveraged SMB/Windows Admin Shares for lateral movement and communication across the network [T1021.002]. To maintain command and control (C2), the malware dynamically registered new DNS A records using fast flux techniques to obscure the location of its C2 servers [T1568.001]. Data exfiltration was conducted over multiple protocols, including unencrypted FTP for transferring stolen files [T1048.003] and Microsoft Office Exchange Web Services API to retrieve data from actor-controlled accounts [T1567]. Additionally, the actors executed email bombing attacks by leveraging a botnet to dispatch spam emails from compromised accounts, overwhelming target systems [T1667], and hijacked bandwidth by redirecting outbound traffic through compromised residential proxies to mask exfiltration activities [T1496.002]. System logs from affected servers showed unusual spikes in network traffic and failed authentication attempts, though these were initially dismissed as routine anomalies. GlobalTech Solutions reported no operational impact during this simulated exercise, but the campaign underscores the need for enhanced monitoring of supply chains and network segmentation.
