In this fictional scenario, APT actors, likely state-sponsored, initiated a campaign against a mid-sized financial services firm, 'SecureBank Inc.,' which recently expanded its digital infrastructure. The attack began with reconnaissance, where the malware harvested passive DNS information from cached resolver data to build a target domain profile [T1590.002], analyzing historical DNS queries to identify internal server names and subdomains. System logs from SecureBank's DNS servers showed unusual query patterns over a two-week period, though initial alerts were dismissed as routine maintenance noise. Leveraging a trusted relationship, the threat actor then used compromised administrative privileges from a third-party vendor, 'TechSupport Pro,' to access sensitive organizational data [T1199], exploiting a weak authentication mechanism in the vendor portal that had not been updated since last quarter. Once initial access was achieved, the adversary executed osascript with AppleScript commands to enumerate running processes and system information [T1059.002], gathering details on macOS endpoints within the network, including user accounts and installed software versions. For persistence and execution, BITTER has used scheduled tasks [T1053.005], and in this case, the actors created a scheduled task to run a malicious script every hour, disguised as a system update process, while simultaneously registering a password filter DLL on domain controllers to harvest plain-text credentials [T1556.002], capturing login attempts across the Active Directory environment. Internal network traffic logs indicated sporadic FTP connections to an external IP address, as CARROTBALL has the ability to use FTP in C2 communications [T1071.002], with the actors exfiltrating stolen data in encrypted archives during off-peak hours. Finally, to cause disruption and spread disinformation, attackers modified the corporate directory website to display fake organizational changes and resignations [T1491.001], altering HTML files to show fabricated executive departures, which was discovered during a routine content audit by the marketing team. The incident was contained after simulated blue team exercises identified anomalous scheduled tasks and DNS queries, leading to a full network scan and credential reset.
