On October 15, 2023, Crimson Shadow initiated a campaign by posting false advertisements for software packages and browser updates to distribute malware via malvertising [T1583.008]. Concurrently, the actors compromised legitimate email accounts [T1586.002] and altered MX records on DNS servers [T1584.002] to intercept email traffic containing authentication credentials, which were then used in spearphishing operations targeting high-value employees. In a parallel effort, the adversary altered the continuous integration server configuration to deploy malware-laden software updates to customers as part of a supply chain compromise [T1195], leveraging a trusted relationship by compromising an Office 365 partner account [T1199] to elevate privileges and access customer tenant data. Upon execution, Crimson Shadow employed AutoHotKey and AutoIT scripts [T1059.010] to decrypt payloads and load them into victim memory, while establishing persistence by creating and running a Windows service [T1543.003] that operated until encryption processes were complete. The actors further modified Unix shell configurations [T1546.004] to launch data exfiltration scripts during system initialization and injected a Skeleton Key into the domain controller [T1556.001] to enable universal password access. To evade detection, the malicious process invoked NtQueryInformationProcess() with ProcessDebugPort for debugger evasion [T1622] and used steganography tools [T1001.002] to embed command and control data within digital photographs, retrieving Base64 encoded stagers from C2 servers [T1132.001]. Data was staged using commands like 'cmd.exe /c xcopy C:\Financial\*.xlsx C:\Windows\Temp\data\ /S' [T1074] to collect spreadsheet files into hidden locations, and external defacement was employed [T1491.002] by injecting malicious code to display fake technical support numbers for social engineering attacks. System logs from affected entities showed unusual network traffic spikes and unauthorized access attempts, with background checks revealing no prior incidents at 'FinTech Global Inc.', a fictional mid-sized technology firm used as a primary target in this scenario.
