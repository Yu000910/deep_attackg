    "clean_text": "On October 15, 2023, a fictional multinational corporation, 'Globex Corp', reported suspicious network activity following a phishing campaign. Initial analysis revealed that the adversary likely conducted reconnaissance by querying HTTP User-Agent strings to gather victim host information and sent phishing emails to employees requesting VPN client configuration details as part of gathering client configurations. Network administrators later discovered a passive tap on the server room's Ethernet line, indicating hardware additions for data interception. The malware employed systemd timers to execute malicious scripts at predetermined intervals while using spwebmember to enumerate and dump information from Microsoft SharePoint. Concurrently, the threat actor activated a Wi-Fi Pineapple to perform SSL stripping and intercept unencrypted communication through an evil twin attack. For command and control, the primary channel used port 443, with port 80 serving as a fallback channel. Finally, the adversary ran a SYN flood script against the authentication service to exhaust connection pool resources in an OS exhaustion flood. System logs from Globex Corp's firewall showed increased traffic on port 80, unrelated to the attack, and background checks revealed the company had recently upgraded its SharePoint infrastructure, which was not exploited in this scenario.",
